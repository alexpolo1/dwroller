      "pageText": "vered by Dark Apostle Bellephrades Daemon Princes are incredibly powerful entities of the warp, vast and nightmarish beings whose essence is the immortal hell- stuff of the Warp embodied, concentrated, and given form. No two are truly alike, although many maintain a roughly humanoid shape when incarnate in the material realm, their exact forms fashioned from congealed horror and marked with the signs and stigmata of whichever great power they themselves serve. Perhaps the most terrible thing about these walking blasphemies is, if the malefic texts of forbidden Daemonology are to be believed, that once they were mortals. Daemon Princes arose from mortal beings (humans, Traitorous Space Marines, and sometimes even alien creatures) who gave themselves over to the worship of Chaos in life and became its dread champions. These champions of Chaos prospered, slaughtered, and found favour with the fickle Chaos Gods who then transfigured them, refashioning their tainted souls into daemonhood. T",

All opponents of the Daemon Prince within this area suffer a –10 penalty to their Willpower. In addition, the first time any member of a Kill-team finds himself within the Aura of Despair and Death, he must take a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test, taking the –10 penalty imposed by the aura into account. If he fails, the squad takes 1 point of cohesion damage. This means that the potential cohesion damage from the Aura of Despair and Death is equal to the number of Battle-Brothers making up the squad.

Melee Attacks made by Hordes cannot be Parried or Dodged unless otherwise noted. Ranged: A Horde may make ranged attacks equal to the first digit of its Magnitude. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde can make two ranged attacks. Any additional hits from sustained fire can be applied to any eligible target. Therefore, if the heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to Brother Silas. Modifiers or range and sustained fire apply as normal, but a Horde can never aim. Ammo expenditure and Jamming are never applied to Hordes—they always have enough bullets to keep firing. damage Caused By Hordes Any attack from a Horde that hits has the damage it causes increased by a number of d10s equal to the Horde’s Magnitude divided by ten, with a maximum bonus of +2d10. This is in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that the Horde is armed with. It will also include the Strength Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons. The damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness bonus and armour as normal. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a heretic would do with its axe (1d10+5), and therefore causes 3d10+5 damage if they hit in combat. Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10+2 damage with its ranged attacks. This represents an enemy being mobbed with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking like rain on a single target. creaTing a horde To create a Horde is simply a matter of taking a minion entry from this chapter and replacing its wounds with the Magnitude value of your choosing. examPle Horde This Horde is a large mob of Chaos Heretics.

Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde can make two ranged attacks. Any additional hits from sustained fire can be applied to any eligible target. Therefore, if the heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to Brother Silas. Modifiers or range and sustained fire apply as normal, but a Horde can never aim. Ammo expenditure and Jamming are never applied to Hordes—they always have enough bullets to keep firing. damage Caused By Hordes Any attack from a Horde that hits has the damage it causes increased by a number of d10s equal to the Horde’s Magnitude divided by ten, with a maximum bonus of +2d10. This is in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that the Horde is armed with. It will also include the Strength Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons. The damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness bonus and armour as normal. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a heretic would do with its axe (1d10+5), and therefore causes 3d10+5 damage if they hit in combat. Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10+2 damage with its ranged attacks. This represents an enemy being mobbed with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking like rain on a single target. creaTing a horde To create a Horde is simply a matter of taking a minion entry from this chapter and replacing its wounds with the Magnitude value of your choosing. examPle Horde This Horde is a large mob of Chaos Heretics.

They see ranged combat as more desirable to the carnage of hand-to- hand combat, preferring to use their advanced weaponry rather than brute force to win battles. Tau Fire Warriors serve for many years, and if they survive for long enough, they may become Commanders. Eventually, they will be allowed to retire from active service, join the council of advisors, and play a greater part in Tau politics.

Melee Attacks made by Hordes cannot be Parried or Dodged unless otherwise noted. Ranged: A Horde may make ranged attacks equal to the first digit of its Magnitude. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde can make two ranged attacks. Any additional hits from sustained fire can be applied to any eligible target. Therefore, if the heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to Brother Silas. Modifiers or range and sustained fire apply as normal, but a Horde can never aim. Ammo expenditure and Jamming are never applied to Hordes—they always have enough bullets to keep firing. damage Caused By Hordes Any attack from a Horde that hits has the damage it causes increased by a number of d10s equal to the Horde’s Magnitude divided by ten, with a maximum bonus of +2d10. This is in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that the Horde is armed with. It will also include the Strength Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons. The damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness bonus and armour as normal. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a heretic would do with its axe (1d10+5), and therefore causes 3d10+5 damage if they hit in combat. Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10+2 damage with its ranged attacks. This represents an enemy being mobbed with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking like rain on a single target. creaTing a horde To create a Horde is simply a matter of taking a minion entry from this chapter and replacing its wounds with the Magnitude value of your choosing. examPle Horde This Horde is a large mob of Chaos Heretics.
