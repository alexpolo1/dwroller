    "content": "the grim darkness of the far future could now be explored by\nlegions of roleplaying enthusiasts. The popularity of Dark\nheresy outstripped all expectations, and it was clear that the\nidea of roleplaying in the 41st Millennium was as strong, if\nnot stronger than it had ever been. The subsequent licensing\nof the property to Fantasy Flight Games first consolidated and\nthen built on this success, in somewhat spectacular fashion it\nhas to be said. FFG have already produced a string of high\nquality supplements for Dark heresy and in 2009 launched\nrogue traDer, the second core rulebook in the series,\nand associated supplements. With this amazing wealth of\nmaterial and the growing popularity of both strands, it is now\ndifficult to imagine a roleplaying scene without a Warhammer\n40,000 presence.\nThis volume, Deathwatch, completes the triptych of 40K\nRoleplay core rulebooks and introduces the Space Marines.\nThat this book is devoted to the Adeptus Astartes explains\nto some extent the structure of the whole 40K roleplay line.\nAs I said earlier, a few years ago a small group of people at\nGames Workshop began to think seriously about how we\nmight actually publish a 40K roleplaying game. There was, if\nI recall, much excitement and quite a few proposals as to how\nwe might approach such a venture. Broadly speaking these\nproposals fell into one of two camps. On the one side was the\nopinion that because Space Marines were so powerful in the\nsetting it made no sense to have them being featured alongside\nother characters at low levels of play and that therefore\nincluding them at all would simply unbalance the game. On\nthe other side was the opinion that a 40K game without\nSpace Marines was just unthinkable and that the game would\nhave little interest if they were left out. So did we publish a\n40K roleplaying game with or without Space Marines? The\nsolution we eventually settled upon was to do both!\nIn fact, we went one further and sketched out a plan that\nadded a third core rulebook to the set. This gave us, on paper\nat least, an interesting progression through the universe of\nthe 41st Millennium and through the power levels of the\nplayer characters. We also gave tentative themes and titles to\nthe three core rulebooks.\nDark heresy would introduce the\nuniverse to roleplayers and provide a very strong environment\nfor developing low level, inexperienced characters under the\naegis of the Inquisition (a format very much inspired by the\nearlier and perfectly successful tabletop game InquIsItor\nby Games Workshop). rogue traDer would expand the\ngame’s horizons and introduce higher level characters and\nadventures and maybe the first look at a playable Space\nMarine. Finally Deathwatch would present the Space Marines\nin all of their glory—the ultimate warriors facing the most\ndangerous challenges.\nAs it turned out, the GW team only got to do part one of\nthe set and that book along with the plan we had sketched\nout was offered to FFG when they acquired the license. To\nour delight, they liked both\nDark heresy and our plan and\nimmediately set about turning parts two and three into a reality.\nIn the course of doing this it has been inevitable that Ross\nand his teams have had to adapt those initial ideas somewhat.\nAs well as making some essential changes and developments\nthey have added an enormous amount of original material of\ntheir own devising to the final fleshed-out products. This has\nresulted in the most amazing series of roleplaying books, as\nyou can no doubt ascertain for yourself by examining the book\nin your hands right now. This realisation of those early ideas\nin such a high quality fashion and the dedication and ongoing\ncommitment of FFG to the property is immensely satisfying to\nthose of us at GW who were involved in those early planning\nmeetings. It is good to know that the ‘Holy Grail’ has not\nonly been grasped but that it is in such talented hands. The\n41st Millennium may be grim and dark but the future of 40K\nroleplaying looks very bright indeed.\nAlan Merrett,\nGames Workshop 2010",

Worlds burned in the name of the Dark Gods,\nand a terror unlike any seen before was unleashed.

Sanguinius of the Blood Angels and\nRogal Dorn of the Imperial Fists, together with their bravest\nwarriors, would accompany the Emperor and take the fight to\nHorus upon his battle-barge, a mighty warship in orbit above\nTerra. The Emperor and his warriors teleported onto Horus’\nbattle-barge but found themselves separated and scattered\nthroughout the corrupt vessel by means of dark sorcery. The\nEmperor fought his way to the Warmaster but was too late to\nsave Sanguinius, who Horus slew when the angelic Primarch\nrefused to turn to Chaos.

Horus was filled with the power of the Dark Gods and\ndealt the Emperor a mortal blow, but in the end, the Emperor’s\nwill was the greater, and Horus was struck down with the last\nounce of the Emperor’s strength. The traitor was destroyed\nutterly and, with his death, the power of the Traitor Legions\nwas broken. When Dorn and his warriors finally fought\ntheir way into the rebel warmaster’s sanctum, they found the\nEmperor’s broken and ruined body, and it is said that their\ncries of woe were heard far below on Terra itself.\nRogal Dorn, most determined and unbending of the\nPrimarchs, bore his master’s body back to Terra and, under\nthe direction of the crippled Emperor, bound him within the\nGolden Throne to sustain his existence for all eternity with\nconstant sacrifice and baroque machineries. The followers of\nthe Ruinous Powers were defeated, but it was victory won at a\nterrible cost. The brotherhood of the Primarchs was sundered,\nand the Emperor’s vision for the Imperium and all of Mankind\nlay in ruins—the last, best hope of its fulfilment lost forever.\nThe galactic empire he had forged was all but destroyed, and\nit was to take many more years of brutal warfare before all the\nTraitor forces were defeated and driven into the hellish chaos\nof the Eye of Terror.

Once Horus was\ndefeated, it was decided that the forces of the Imperium\nwould be reorganised so that a similar catastrophe could not\nbe repeated.\nThe Space Marine Legions were divided up to create\none Chapter of the same name as the founding Legion and\na number of new Chapters with new names. This event was\ncalled the Second Founding, and over two dozen further\nFoundings have occurred in the ten millennia since. It is\nnot known exactly how many Chapters were created in the\naftermath of the Horus Heresy, as many of the Imperium’s\nrecords are incomplete or lost entirely, and whole Chapters\nhave been created and destroyed in the millennia that have\nfollowed.

The first High\nLords of Terra established the structure by which the Adeptus\nTerra operated, and described the feudal responsibilities and\nduties of the planetary lords. One of the most important\naccomplishments was the reorganisation of the Imperium’s\nfighting forces. This was undertaken almost single-handedly by\nthe Primarch of the Ultramarines Legion, Roboute Guilliman,\nwho with characteristic speed and efficiency codified the\nstructure of the Imperial Guard, the Imperial Navy, and\nthe Space Marines. Of all of his works, the most influential\nis the Codex Astartes, the great prescriptive tome that lays\ndown the basic organisational and tactical rules for the Space\nMarine Chapters.\nThe Codex Astartes decreed that Space Marines would\nbe created and trained over a controlled period of time.\nThe genetic banks used to cultivate the implants that turn a\nnormal man into a mighty Space Marine would be carefully\nmonitored, and cultivated organs would be subject to the most\nstringent tests of purity. Young initiates would undergo rigorous\ntrials of physical and psychological suitability before they\nwere accepted, and only those of the highest calibre would\nbe chosen.\nOn Earth, the Adeptus Terra created genetic repositories\nto produce and store Space Marine gene-seed. These banks\nwere used to provide all new gene-seed for Space Marines\nand, to prevent cross-contamination, the genetic material of\neach of the old Legions was isolated. Henceforth, the new\nSpace Marine Chapters would receive gene-seed only from\ntheir own genetic stock.\nThe gene-seed of the Traitor Legions was placed under a\ntime-locked stasis seal, although at the time, many believed\nthese dangerous stocks should be destroyed. By taking direct\ncontrol of the genetic stocks, the Adepts of Terra could\nultimately control the Space Marines. Now they alone had the\npower to destroy or create Space Marine chapters at will.",

Tissue compatibility is also\nessential, otherwise organs may fail to develop properly.\nThe third consideration is mental suitability. Several of the\nimplants will only develop to a usable condition under the\nstimulus of hypnotic-suggestion. A recruit must therefore be\nsusceptible to this particular treatment.\nThese conditions mean that only a small proportion of\naspirants prove suitable to become Space Marines, even if\nthey survive the trials. They must be male, because zygotes\nare keyed to male hormones and tissue types, hence the need\nfor tissue compatibility tests and psychological screening. If\nthese prove successful, a candidate becomes a Neophyte. With\nthe completion of organ implantation and attendant chemical\nand hypnotic training, the subject is ready to take his place in",

    "content": "gene-Seed\nThere are nineteen varieties of gene-seed corresponding to\nthe nineteen different superhuman organs that are surgically\nimplanted into a Space Marine. Because most Chapters have\nexisted for many thousands of years, a number of these\nChapters have gene-seed that has mutated over time. This\nhas resulted in changes in the exact nature of the artificially\ncultured organs. Such changes may sometimes make an\nimplant useless—such is the case with the Imperial Fists, who\nare known to lack the organ called the Betcher’s gland, which\nallows a Space Marine to spit corrosive poison. In other cases,\nthe changes in an organ might reduce its effectiveness or cause\nstrange new effects—the Salamanders, for example, share\nskin as dark as coal, due to the actions of their melanchromic\norgan. Whatever the result, it will affect the entire Chapter,\nas all Space Marines belonging to the Chapter share implants\ncultured from the original gene-seed.\nAlthough a Chapter’s Apothecaries and surgeons are able\nto perform the necessary implant operations, they do not\nnecessarily understand the exact functioning of each organ.\nThe processes involved are incredibly ancient. Procedures\nare handed down from generation to generation, becoming\nincreasingly ritualised and misinterpreted. For these reasons,\nthe efficiency of each organ differs from Chapter to Chapter,\ndepending on the condition of the Chapter’s gene-seed and\nthe degree of debasement of its surgical procedures. In some\nChapters, mutation of gene-seed, poor surgical procedure,\nor inadequate post-operative conditioning has twisted the\nfunctioning of implants.\nIn addition to the problem of mutated implants, many\nChapters have simply lost one or more types of gene-seed\norgans due to accident, genetic failure, or some other cause.\nVery few Chapters, therefore, possess all nineteen of the\nimplants. All possess the carapace implant however, as without\nit, the Neophyte could never become a Space Marine.\nEach of the gene-seed organs is extremely complicated.\nMany of the organs only work properly when another organ\nis present, the loss or mutation of one organ often affecting\nthe exact functioning of the others. For these reasons, implants\nmust be constantly monitored, and many Space Marines must\nundergo corrective surgery to re-balance their metabolisms.",

    "content": "In addition to the extensive implantation process, the Neophyte\nundergoes chemical treatment, psychological conditioning,\nand subconscious hypnotherapy, all the while spending\nevery waking hour honing his combat skills with ceaseless\nbattle training.\nUntil his initiation as a Battle-Brother, a Neophyte must\nsubmit to constant tests and examinations. The newly implanted\norgans must be monitored very carefully, imbalances corrected,\nand any sign of corrupt development treated. This chemical\ntreatment is reduced after completion of the initiation process,\nbut it never ends. Space Marines undergo periodic treatment for\nthe rest of their lives in order to maintain a stable metabolism.\nTo this end, power armour contains extensive monitoring and\ndrug dispensation equipment.\nAs the super-enhanced body grows, the recipient must learn\nhow to use his new skills. Some of the implants, specifically\nthe Catalespean Node and Occulobe, can only function once\ncorrect hypnotherapy has been administered. Hypnotherapy\nis not always as effective as chemical treatment, but it can\nhave substantial results. If a Space Marine can be taught how\nto control his own metabolism, his dependence on drugs is\nlessened. The process is undertaken in a machine called a\nhypnomat. Space Marines are placed in a state of hypnosis and\nsubjected to visual and aural images in order to awaken their\nminds to their unconscious metabolic processes.\nA Space Marine is more than a human with extraordinary\npowers. Just as their bodies receive nineteen separate implants,\nso their minds are altered to release the latent powers within.\nThese mental powers are, if anything, more extraordinary\nthan even the physical powers endowed by the implants. For\nexample, a Space Marine can control his senses and nervous\nsystem to a remarkable degree, and can consequently endure\npain that would kill a normal man. A Space Marine can also\nthink and react at lightning speeds. Memory training is an\nimportant part of the indoctrination as well. Some Space\nMarines develop photographic memories. Space Marines vary\nin intelligence as do other men, and their individual mental\nabilities vary in degree.\nThe very first stage in the process is the implantation of\nthe Secondary\bHeart, normally between the age of ten\nand fourteen. This is capable of boosting the blood supply\nor sustaining full life functions even after the destruction",

    "content": "of the recipient’s original heart. This implant enables Space\nMarines to survive low oxygen concentrations and traumatic\ninjury, and is also necessary in the maintenance of the subject’s\nmetabolism, which will be pushed to its limits as his body is\nsubject to the many surgical procedures it will endure over the\nnext several years.\nThe next stage in the implantation process is the addition\nof the Ossmodula. This is a tube-shaped organ whose small\nsize belies its complex structure. The Ossmodula monitors and\nsecretes hormones affecting epiphiseal fusion and ossification\nof the skeleton. At the same time, the specially engineered\nhormones encourage the forming bones to absorb ceramicyears following implantation, this will have caused considerable\nstrengthening of the long bones, extreme ossification of the\nchest cavity (caused by growth of the ribs forming a solid mass\nof inter-laced bone plates), and a general increase in the size of\nthe recipient’s skeleton.\nNormally implanted at the same time as the Ossmodula,\nthe Biscopea is emplaced within the chest cavity. It is small,\napproximately spherical and, like the Ossmodula, its primary\nfunction is hormonal. The presence of the Biscopea stimulates\nmuscle growth throughout the body. These muscles bond to\nthe rapidly growing skeleton, which is why these two implants\nare often undergone at the same time.\nPhases four and five are often implanted at the same time,\nbetween the ages of twelve and fourteen. The Haemastamen\nis a tiny organ, placed within a main blood vessel and serves\ntwo main purposes. Firstly, it monitors and to some degree\ncontrols the Ossmodula and the Biscopea. It also alters the\nconstituent make-up of the recipient’s blood. As a result, the\nSpace Marine’s blood will be considerably more efficient than\nordinary human blood, as it has to be considering the extra\nbiological hardware the Space Marine carries inside him.\nThe second implant emplaced at this time is the Larraman’s\b\nOrgan. This is a liver-shaped, dark, fleshy organ. It is implanted\ninto the chest cavity along with a complicated array of blood\nvessels. The organ generates and stores special Larraman cells.\nIf the recipient is wounded, these cells are released into the\nbloodstream, where they latch onto leucocytes in the blood\nand are transported to the site of the wound. Once outside\nthe body, the Larraman cells form a skin substitute of instant\nscar tissue, staunching the flow of blood and protecting any\nexposed wound area. This process is almost instantaneous, and\nit can appear to the onlooker as if the blood is frozen solid\neven before it hits the ground.\nWith the initiation of phase six, the subject is ready to begin\nthe extensive hypnotherapy that will continue throughout\nthe entire initiation process, and beyond. The Catalepsean\b\nNode is a brain implant usually inserted into the back of the\nskull via a hole drilled into the occipital bone. The pea-sized\norgan influences the circadian rhythms of sleep and the body’s\nresponse to sleep deprivation. Normally, a Space Marine sleeps\nlike any normal man, but if deprived of it, the Catalepsean\nNode becomes active. The recipient is capable of sleeping\nand remaining awake at the same time by switching off areas\nof the brain sequentially. This process cannot replace normal\nsleep entirely, but it increases a Space Marine’s survivability by\nallowing awareness of the environment whilst resting.\nThe next three phases of the process, the implantation\nof the Preomnor, Omophagea and Multi-lung are often\nundertaken at the same time, between the ages of fourteen\nand sixteen. The Preomnor is a large implant which fits into\nthe chest cavity. It is a pre-digestive stomach which allows\nthe recipient to eat a variety of otherwise poisonous or\nindigestible materials. No actual digestion tales place in the\nPreomnor. Instead, individual sensory tubes assess potential\npoisons and neutralise them or, where necessary, isolate the\nPreomnor from the rest of the digestive tract. The Omophagea\nis a complicated implant that is placed within the spinal cord\nbetween the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, where it becomes\nin effect part of the brain. Four nerve sheaths called neuroclea\nare implanted between the spine and the preomnoral stomach\nwall. The Omophagea is designed to absorb genetic material\ngenerated in animal tissue as a function of memory. This\nendows the Space Marine with an unusual survival trait—he\ncan actually learn by eating. If a Space Marine eats part of a\ncreature, he will absorb some of the memories of that creature.\nThis can be very useful in an alien environment. Incidentally, it\nis the presence of this organ which has created the various flesh\neating and blood drinking rituals for which many Chapters are\nknown, as well as giving the names to Chapters such as the\nBlood Drinkers and Flesh Tearers. The third organ implanted\nat this time is the Multi-lung. This large, tubular, grey organ\nis sometimes called the ‘third lung’. Blood is pumped through\nthe organ via connecting vessels grafted onto the recipient’s\npulmonary system. Atmosphere is taken in by means of a\nsphincter located in the trachea. In toxic atmospheres, an\nassociated sphincter muscle closes the trachea and restricts\nnormal breathing, thus protecting the lungs. The Multi-lung is\nable to absorb oxygen from poorly oxygenated or poisonous\nair without suffering damage thanks to its own efficient toxin\ndispersal, neutralisation, and regeneration systems.\nPhase ten of the process is the implantation of the\nOcculobe. This small slug-like organ sits at the base of the\nbrain. It provides the hormonal and genetic stimuli which\nenable a Space Marine’s eyes to respond to optic-therapy. The\nOcculobe does not in itself improve a Space Marine’s eyesight,\nbut it allows technicians to make adjustments to the growth\npatterns of the eye and the light-receptive retinal cells. A Space\nMarine has far better eyesight than a normal human, and can\nsee in low light conditions almost as well as in daylight.\nPhase eleven is the addition of the Lyman’s\bEar. This\norgan enables a Space Marine to consciously enhance and\neven filter certain types of background noise. Not only is\nhearing improved, but a Space Marine cannot become dizzy\nor nauseous as a result of extreme disorientation. A Lyman’s\nEar is externally indistinguishable from a normal human ear.\nBetween the ages of fifteen and sixteen, phase twelve is\ninitiated, in which a flat, circular organ called the Sus-an\b\nMembrane is implanted over the top of the exposed brain.\nIt then grows into the brain tissue until completely merged.\nThe organ is not effective until subsequent chemical therapy\nand training is applied. However, a properly tutored Space\nMarine may then enter into a state of suspended animation.\nThis may be a conscious action, or may happen automatically\nin the event of extreme physical trauma. In this condition,\na Space Marine may survive for many years, even if bearing",

The longest known period of\ndeanimation followed by successful reanimation is 567 years,\nin the case of Brother Silas Err of the Dark Angels Chapter.\nThe next phase of the process is the implantation of the\nMelanchromic\bOrgan. This hemispherical, black organ\nfunctions in an indirect and extremely complex manner. It\nmonitors radiation levels and types bombarding the skin,\nand if necessary, sets off chemical reactions to darken the\nskin and protect it from ultraviolet exposure. It also provides\nlimited protection from other forms of radiation. Differing\nMelanchromic Organ gene-seed from Chapter to Chapter leads\nto variations in skin and hair colour, and in some Chapters all\nof the Space Marines may have identical colouration, such as is\nfound in the albino warriors of the Death Spectres Chapter.\nPhases fourteen and fifteen, the implantation of the Oolitic\b\nKidney and the Neuroglottis, are often undertaken at the\nsame time. The Oolitic Kidney is red-brown and heart-shaped\nand improves and modifies the Space Marine’s circulatory\nsystem, enabling other implants to function effectively. The\nOolitic Kidney also filters blood extremely efficiently and\nquickly. The Secondary Heart and Oolitic Kidney are able to\nact together, performing an emergency detoxification function\nin which the Space Marine is rendered unconscious as his\nblood is circulated at high speed. This enables a Space Marine\nto survive poisons and gases which are otherwise too much\nfor even the multi-lung to cope with. The Neuroglottis enables\nthe Space Marine to assess a potential food by taste. The organ\nis implanted in the back of the mouth. By chewing, or simply\nby tasting, a Space Marine can detect a wide variety of natural\npoisons, some chemicals and even the distinctive odours of\nsome creatures. To some degree, a Space Marine is also able to\ntrack a target by taste alone.\nIn phase sixteen, normally at age sixteen, a small organ\ncalled the Mucranoid is implanted in the lower intestine\nwhere its hormonal secretions are absorbed by the colon.\nThese secretions initiate a modification of the sweat glands.\nThis modification normally makes no difference to the Space\nMarine until activated by appropriate chemical therapy. As\na result of this treatment, the Space Marine sweats an oily,\nnaturally cleansing substance which coats the skin. This\nprotects the Space Marine against extremes of temperature\nand even offers a slight degree of protection against vacuum.\nMucranoid chemical therapy is standard procedure in long\nspace voyages and when fighting in vacuum or near-vacuum.\nPhase seventeen is the implantation of two identical organs\ncalled Betcher’s\bGlands. These are placed into the lower\nlip, alongside the salivary glands or into the hard palette. The\nBetcher’s Gland works in a similar way to the poison gland of\nvenomous reptiles by synthesising and storing deadly poison.\nSpace Marines are rendered immune to this poison by virtue\nof the gland’s presence. The gland allows the Space Marine to\nspit a blinding contact poison, which is also highly corrosive.\nA Space Marine imprisoned behind iron bars could easily\nchew his way out given a few hours.\nIn the penultimate phase of the process, a pair of glands\ncalled Progenoids are implanted, one in the neck and the\nother deep in the chest cavity. This takes place between the age\nof sixteen and eighteen. These glands are vitally important to\nthe very survival of the Space Marine’s Chapter. Each organ\ngrows within the Space Marine, absorbing hormonal stimuli\nand genetic material from the other implants. After five years,\nthe neck gland is mature and ready for removal. After ten\nyears, the chest gland becomes mature and is also ready to\nbe removed. A gland may be removed any time after it has\nmatured, and it represents the Chapter’s only source of genecorresponding to each zygote implanted into the recipient.\nOnce removed by surgery, the Progenoid must be carefully\nprepared, its individual gene-seeds checked for mutation, and\nsound gene-seeds stored. Gene-seeds can be stored indefinitely\nunder suitable conditions.\nSpace Marine Apothecaries carry a special device known\nas a reductor, which they can use in battlefield conditions to\nremove the Progenoid glands of a fallen Space Marine, so\nthat, even should he die before his glands are harvested, they\nmay be recovered. The whole purpose of the Progenoid is to\nprovide gene-seed to enable the Chapter to continue. It is not\npossible to create a zygote in any other way. Each Chapter’s\nstock of gene-seed is therefore unique to itself. Gene-seed has\na great deal of religious significance to a Chapter, representing\nits identity and future. Without gene-seed, a Chapter has no\nfuture. The extinction of a type of gene-seed means that a\nzygote has been lost forever. The extinction of the Progenoid\ngene-seed itself would effectively mean the end to a Chapter.\nAs each Space Marine has only two Progenoid glands,\nthe rate at which a Chapter can create new Space Marines\nis restricted. It may take many years for a Chapter to rebuild\nitself after heavy losses. Gene-seed is often rendered useless if\na Space Marine is exposed to high radiation levels or other\nforms of genetic disturbance. The efficiency of different\nChapters’ Progenoid gene-seed also varies, so some Chapters\nare able to make up their numbers faster than others.\nThe final and the most distinctive implant is the Black\b\nCarapace, which cannot be implanted beyond the age of\neighteen. This looks like a film of black plastic when growing\nin the tanks. This is removed from its culture-solution and cut\ninto sheets, which are implanted directly beneath the skin of\nthe recipient’s torso. Within a few hours, the tissue expands,\nhardens on the outside, and sends invasive neural bundles\ndeep inside the subject. After several months, the recipient is\nfitted with neural sensors and transfusion points, cut into the\nhardened carapace. These artificial interface points mesh with\nfeatures integral to the power armour, such as the monitoring,\nmedicinal, and maintenance units. Without the benefit of the\nBlack Carapace, a Space Marine’s power armour would be far\nless effective.",

Scout squads consist of a Space Marine\nSergeant and four to nine Scouts. The role of the Sergeant\nis to train the Scouts and lead them in battle. Only Sergeants\nof considerable experience and status are designated for this\nrole. Scouts attend to every word their Sergeant utters, for it is\nsaid that he has forgotten more of war than many more senior\nofficers will ever learn.\nWhilst serving as a Scout, a Neophyte learns the most\nsubtle arts of war. In a range of infiltration and reconnaissance\nmissions, he learns how to approach and observe the enemy.\nInformation gathered in such missions is passed back to the\nmain battle force. The Scouts get their first taste of combat\nby way of carefully placed ambushes, the Scout Sergeant\ndrawing on centuries of experience to deploy his charges in\nsuch a manner as to teach them as valuable a lesson as the\nenemy. Unlike that enemy, the Scouts learn valuable skills in\nsuch combats—the enemy earns nothing more than a quick\ndeath, for even a Neophyte Space Marine is a puissant warrior\ncompared to a mortal man.\nA Space Marine serving in a Devastator squad may only\nrecently have completed his service in the Tenth Company\nand been initiated as a Space Marine. It will be his first\nexperience of fighting in power armour. When first assigned\nto such a squad, the Space Marine will bear a bolter and\ngrenades and fulfil a support role within the squad, providing\nclose support to those Battle-Brothers armed with heavy\nweapons, identifying targets and being close at hand to\nproffer ammunition and to take up the weapons of any who\nshould fall. Only when he has proven himself steady and\nreliable in battle will the Space Marine be entrusted with one\nof the Chapter’s mighty heavy weapons, which he will come\nto master over the course of several hundred battles.\nDevastator squads consist of a Sergeant and nine Space\nMarines. Up to four Space Marines may be armed with heavy\nweapons, whilst the remainder will carry bolters. This is\nthe most heavily armed type of Space Marine squad of all,\nand they are deployed wherever overwhelming firepower is\nneeded, especially when the Chapter faces enemy tanks or\nfortified positions.\nHaving proved himself steadfast and disciplined in the\nDevastator squads, a Space Marine will in time earn himself\na place in an Assault squad. Here the Space Marine comes\nto master the application of overwhelming force, taking the\nfight directly to the enemy’s strong points. He embraces the\ncontrolled savagery of close combat and looks his enemy in\nthe eye as he deals him death. Assault squads are specialists\nat fighting in hand-to-hand combat.

This combination is ideal for fast-attacking,\nclose-quarter fighting assault troops.\nEven though Tactical squads are the most common type\nin any Chapter, to earn a place in one a Space Marine must\nhave proven himself both courageous and wise in battle.\nThroughout his service in the Devastator and Assault squads,\nhe will be proven adaptable in his approach to the arts of war\nand will have mastered a range of tactics and weaponry.\nTactical squads are the most commonly fielded squad\ntypes in a Chapter. A Tactical squad is led by a Sergeant and\nincludes nine other Space Marines. Of these, seven Battlecan be armed with bolters or, alternatively, one may carry a\nheavy weapon such as a missile launcher or a heavy bolter,\nand the other may carry a special weapon such as a flamer or\nmeltagun. This combination is the most tactically flexible and\noffers a good mixture of capabilities within the squad.\nAfter serving in hundreds of campaigns and thousands of\nbattles, and having conquered the very worst the galaxy has\nto throw at him, a Space Marine is likely to be considered a\nVeteran. In most Chapters, such an honour is not measured\nby length of service, but in blood spilled, horrors overcome,\nand mighty deeds done. As a prelude to service in the First\n(Veteran) Company, many Space Marine Veterans fulfill the\nrole of Sergeant, leading squads of all types in any of the\nother companies. Thus, many of the Space Marines of the\nVeteran company will be battle-proven leaders as well as\nhighly experienced warriors.\nThe warriors of the Veteran company are fielded in one of\nthree squad types:\nTerminator squads wear the uniquely powerful Terminator\narmour, sometimes called tactical dreadnought armour. This\narmoured suit is massive in construction, virtually turning a\nSpace Marine into a one-man tank. Every Chapter has a limited\nnumber of Terminator armour suits, and each is an ancient\nartefact crafted many thousands of years ago. Terminators are\nless mobile than other Space Marines and are primarily used\nin boarding actions or in extreme close quarters when heavy\nfire support cannot be easily brought to bear. So resilient is\nthe armour that it is reputedly able to operate inside plasma\nreactors, within volcanoes, and inside highly irradiated areas\nof deep space. Legend has it that the armour can even survive\nthe tread of a Titan. To wear an ancient suit of Terminator\narmour is one of the greatest honours to which a Space\nMarine can aspire. Each suit bears on its left shoulder the Crux\nTerminatus, the unique badge of the Terminator. Each Crux is\nsaid to contain at its core a tiny fragment of the armour worn\nby the Emperor himself when he fought his final battle against\nthe traitor Warmaster Horus, providing a direct link between\nthe Space Marine and the Father of Mankind.\nDespite its obvious benefits, Terminator armour is not\nsuitable for all missions. Most of the time, Veterans take to the\nfield wearing ordinary power armour, albeit a suit inscribed\nwith many hundreds of battle honours. When wearing power\narmour, Veterans are formed into vanguard Veteran squads or\nsternguard Veteran squads. By dint of their rank, Veterans have\naccess to the most fearsome weaponry in the Chapter’s arsenal,\nincluding sacred blades and artificer-crafted combi-weapons\nof uniquely masterful craftsmanship. Vanguard Veteran\nsquads go to battle equipped with the most lethal of close\ncombat weapons, and often wear jump packs to bring them\nto bear before the enemy can even react. Sternguard Veteran\nsquads carry a wide array of ranged weaponry and specialised\nammunition, and are masters in its overwhelming application.\nVeteran squads are rarely deployed en masse, but are instead\nused to bolster the line, provide an unstoppable speartip or to\nact as a highly flexible and mobile reserve.\nMASTERS OF THE cHAPTER\nEach of the Chapter’s ten companies is led by a Captain.\nThese leaders are second in experience only to the Chapter\nMaster himself, and each is a warrior so deadly that he will\nrarely meet his match. Each Captain is an inspirational and\ndetermined leader, able to coordinate the Space Marines under\nhis command whatever the opposition. In addition to leading\nSpace Marines in battle, each Captain holds titles dependent\non his other responsibilities with regard to the workings of\nthe Chapter or its home world, such as Master of the Fleet or\nMaster of the Marches.\nOf the thousand awesome and terrifying warriors that\ncomprise a Space Marine Chapter, there is but one Chapter\nMaster, a leader with centuries of experience in the very\ncrucible of battle. His own fighting skills will be unsurpassed,\nwhether in the use of gun, blade, or bare hands. His very\nrank speaks of a past littered with the bodies of bloodied,\nbeaten foes of the most terrifying and inhuman sort. It is not\nenough, however, for the Chapter Master to be its foremost\nwarrior. He must also be a superb tactician, grounded in the\nteachings of the Codex Astartes and honed through countless\ndecisions made in the maelstrom of close action. His soldiers\nare also his brothers, and he knows that they will give their\nlives at his command. He must preserve these magnificent\nfighters, but must also accomplish his mission and uphold the\nhonour of his Chapter. He will be steeped in the lore of his\nChapter and be sworn to keep its secrets and must conduct\nhis diplomacy accordingly, for Space Marines maintain a web\nof time-proven oaths and honours debts and do not simply\nheed the commands of Imperial functionaries. Those who\nwish a Chapter Master to send his warriors into battle must\ngive him good reason to do so. In addition to this, a Chapter\nMaster will often be the ruler of his Chapter’s home world, a\nresource that is too valuable for him to ignore. Amongst the\ngreatest risks facing a Chapter Master is the very power he\nwields, for a Chapter of Space Marines is a force capable of\ndevastating entire worlds at his order.\nEven a Space Marine can feel pride, ferocity, and desire—\nit is, after all, their hero’s soul that drives them to acts of\nselfless sacrifice. But in these things lie the seeds of hubris\nthat can eventually lead to damnation. Any Space Marine, but\nespecially a Chapter Master, must beware the short path to\nvictory, must consider both the ends and the means, and must\nheed the example of Emperor and Primarch.",

However, the\nelite special missions conducted by the Deathwatch require a\ntighter focus on a Space Marine’s natural talents. A Speciality\nhelps guide your character’s development, determining your\nstarting gear, Skills, Talents, and a variety of other factors,\nhelping to build a place for yourself within your kill-team.\nTo determine your Speciality, you make a selection from\nthose available (note that some Chapters are restricted and\nmay not select certain Specialities). Once you know what\nyour character’s Speciality is, copy down all of the relevant\ninformation onto your character sheet—your starting Skills,\nTalents, and gear. In some cases, you will need to make a\nchoice between one thing or another.

These answers should help you\nfocus your thoughts on the emerging personality and history\nof your Space Marine character.\nwhat iS Your hoMeworlD like?\nYou should consider giving some thought to your character’s\nhomeworld, and the culture he grew up in as well. There are\nmany different types of worlds settled by humanity (see page\n292 for some examples), and each can have an impact on how\na character native to that world thinks and acts. What was\nyour home culture like? Were you born into a feral tribe or\nhive gang? Perhaps you were part of a knightly order, or had\nbeen born into your world’s aristocracy?\nHowever, for a Space Marine, the culture of his home\nworld is not as significant as the beliefs and traditions that\nsurround him after he is recruited into his Chapter. After all,\nlittle more than a decade of his life is spent as a human before\nhe begins to be shaped by the Space Marine Chapter that has\nrecruited him.\nwhat iS Your perSonalitY like?\nThe first thing you should consider is your character’s\ndisposition. What is he like? Fiery and passionate, or earthy\nand practical? Is he pessimistic and cynical or does he\nalways have faith that the best will happen? Answering these\nquestions will help to round out your Space Marine beyond\nthe extremes of his Demeanours. What is your instinctive\nresponse to threats, surprises, or pressure to perform?\nwhY were You SeleCteD for the\nDeathwatCh?\nFor many Chapters, the selection of a Space Marine to join the\nDeathwatch is an honour. Some Chapters consider it to be a\nvery high honour, whilst others believe that service with the\nDeathwatch is little more than a diversion of his true duties\namongst his Battle-Brothers. Your Space Marine was specially\nchosen, and you should give some thought as to what factors\nwere involved with that choice.\nPerhaps you accomplished some particularly difficult\ntask, or defeated an especially dangerous enemy. Perhaps\nyou survived a nigh-unstoppable assault, or were wounded\ndefending an important objective...perhaps even a luminary of\nthe Imperium, such as an Inquisitor or Imperial Commander. It\nis also possible that you have been sent to the Deathwatch as a\nform of exile, perhaps to teach you humility or atone for some\nfailure, real or perceived.

Alternatively, the other players may\noffer a thumbs-up or thumbs-down verdict—if the majority\nagree, the character gains the benefits of the Improvement.\nDeSigner’S note: triggering a DeMeanour\nThe intention behind a Space Marine’s Demeanour is to provide an opportunity for the Space Marine to gain a dramatic\nand highly memorable moment (a “divine moment of blessed fury”) once per game. The opportunity provided by the\nDemeanour is inextricably linked to the Space Marine’s Chapter and his own unique strength of personality—it is his\nchance to put the spotlight on just how his Chapter is different from those of his Kill-team Battle-Brothers, or (just as\nsignificant) how that particular Space Marine’s personality is expressed. It is recommended to the GM that triggering a\nDemeanour should always have something extremely impressive occur in-game, even if the Space Marine player’s dice\nutterly desert him. A Triggered Demeanour that results in an attack that hits and fails to do damage, for example, could\nstill knock down the enemy—or (should the enemy escape) leave him with a distinctive scar that he will bear forevermore.\nIt is left to the GM’s discretion for the exact effects of this, but it should be suitably epic and reward the Space Marine for\nroleplaying his Demeanour.\nin Your hanDS\nSome players may be used to having the Game Master keep track of a character’s particular strengths and weaknesses.\nHowever, Game Masters have lots to do during a game. The GM manages the story, the pacing, the NPC’s, the challenges,\nand describes the action. It is very easy for a GM to forget an additional detail for each character whilst handling all the\nother myriad aspects of his job. In addition, the player has his Demeanours listed prominently on his own character sheet\nand is far more aware of the effects that the events in the game are having on his character than anyone else. Therefore,\nif Demeanours are meant to come into play regularly during the game, it would be good to place them into the player’s\nhands. Lastly, Deathwatch is at its best when the players themselves shape the course of the experience, from Cohesion\nto the Mission structure to the choice of Kill-team Leader. The reasons listed above are why the decision was made to\nmake Triggering Demeanours a choice that is firmly under the player’s control.",

However, if you\nhave difficulty coming up with a name on the spot (like many\nother gamers!), this section will help guide you in creating a\ngreat name for your Space Marine.\nNames within the 41st Millennium are as varied as the\nmany thousands of worlds that make up the Imperium. As\nmankind is an inventive and contrary creature, there are no\nstandard or universal conventions that govern the names\npeople give themselves. In some places, a single simple name\nmight indicate low birth and ignominy, whilst in others,\nit might act as a mark of extreme wealth, fame, and good\nbreeding. When deciding upon a name, feel free to mix and\nmatch any of the suggestions made by the naming tables. The\nidea, of course, is to create a name that suits your character—\nand no one knows more about your character than you do!\nother warhaMMer 40,000 roleplaY CharaCterS anD DeathwatCh\nThe most important information for players of Dark heresy and rogue traDer is that Deathwatch uses the same\ncore mechanics and takes place in the same universe. There are some theme-related differences in the rules between these\ngames, but Dark heresy and rogue traDer players should feel right at home with the way the game itself works.\nIt is important to note that Deathwatch Space Marines are quite powerful (particularly in combat!) in relation to\nDark heresy and rogue traDer characters. A rogue traDer character with 14,000 xp is roughly equivalent to a\nRank 1 Deathwatch Space Marine (in that the Rogue Trader has a great deal of power tied up in his wealth and personal\nstarship!), and a Dark heresy character using an Ascended Career from ascension with 14,000 xp is also roughly equal\n(having his own strengths in regards to Influence, many knowledge and investigative skills, and so forth). It is strongly\nrecommended that the GM consider carefully before mixing Space Marines into Dark heresy and rogue traDer\ncampaigns, because the Space Marine’s combat abilities are significantly higher than any other type of character.\nDark heresy characters using ascension are particularly recommended if you wish to combine the two games. An\nOrdo Xenos Inquisitor and his trusted Throne Agents are quite appropriate to accompany a Deathwatch Space Marine\n(or even an entire Kill-team) on a mission, or set of missions, of particular import.\nrequiSition & warhaMMer 40,000 roleplaY\nIt is assumed that, in Deathwatch, characters from other Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay games have some special\ndispensation to accompany the Space Marines on their missions (for instance, if one of the player characters is an\nInquisitor). Throne Gelt and a Rogue Trader’s Profit Factor have no meaning for the Deathwatch. Therefore, the other\ncharacters also benefit from the Requisition rules and may acquire Renown at the GM’s discretion (see pages 138–141\nfor more information about Requisition and Renown).\nIf a Deathwatch character joins a Dark heresy or rogue traDer game, the GM is encouraged to determine a\nfair method of applying Requisition to the Space Marine character rather than participating in Profit Factor, Influence,\nor Throne Gelt (all of these terms are explained in rogue traDer, ascension, and Dark heresy, respectively). Space\nMarines themselves generally do not use money!\nTable 1–11: Space Marine Names\n1d10 Roll Black Templar Blood Angel Dark Angel Space Wolf Storm Warden Ultramarine\n1WilhelmZoraelNaamanLoganLorgathMarcus\n2SigismundClotenZaharielMagniAlistayrClaudius\n3AlyxanderAstramaelAstelanIvarBennitGannys\n4AnselmBellerophonCadmusSkifCameroneVaren\n5NavarreMetraenBethorSkoldKestyrQuintus\n6BertramSepheranMagronYngvarMorganScipio\n7GervhartDonatosNemielBalmungKurroInvictus\n8KonradRafenElyasHreidarAngusLucian\n9RaimerArkioMakradonHaakonKenshenPasanius\n10KhordelLeonatosCalibosErikRamsayUriel",

These rules are discussed in detail in Chapter VIII: Playing the Game, but here’s a brief summary so you\nhave an idea of what they encompass.\nBecause the Space Marines of the Deathwatch are drawn from Chapters across the Galaxy, they are not as comfortable\nworking together as with the Battle-Brothers of their home Chapters. Some Space Marines may find themselves serving\nalongside rivals or even enemies, and overcoming those differences can be quite challenging.\nolo Mode represents a Deathwatch Space Marine in his natural state soon after arriving at Watch Fortress Erioch.\nIn Solo Mode, the Space Marine’s particular special abilities, beliefs, and traditions that are part of his home Chapter\nare emphasised. He is relying on his instincts and the decades or even centuries of experience fighting alongside other\nBattle-Brothers of his home Chapter. A Space Marine is never more an exemplar of what it means to be a battle brother\nof his Chapter than when he is in Solo Mode.\nquad Mode is a way of representing a Kill-team that has set aside their differences and are focusing on working\ntogether as a team. In Squad Mode, the Space Marines are not as focused on their individual Chapter abilities, instead\ngaining the benefits of teamwork and being able to act as a unit. When Space Marines are in Squad Mode, they are a\nnearly-unstoppable unit of deadly warriors.\nWhen a Kill-team is in Squad Mode, they have access to a resource known as Cohesion. Cohesion may be spent to\ntrigger certain effects and abilities that benefit the group and allow the Kill-team to perform incredible feats.\nYou can find more detailed game information about these terms on page 219 (for Squad Mode), page 215 (for Solo",

One deviation is in the recruitment and training\nof its warriors. The Black Templars have no Scout company in\nwhich new recruits may prove their mettle. The Chapter must\njudge the worthiness of its recruits in other ways. From the\nmonolithic chapter keeps they establish on every world the\nBlack Templars conquer, the Chaplains maintain a strict vigil\nover the world and judge the worth of those warriors who\nattract their notice. Often, there will be contests of arms or\nother equally lethal trials held for those who aspire to joining\nthe Chapter. Only the bravest warriors can hope to reach the\nfinal stages of selection and even then only a fraction will meet\nthe Chaplains’ high standards.\nAn aspirant is brought to the chapter keep, where the\nApothecaries administer tissue compatibility tests and root out\nany latent mutation to ensure that he is of sufficient purity and\nstrength to become a Neophyte. Not all survive these processes,\nas the Black Templars tolerate no weakness. Should the aspirant\nsurvive, he becomes a Neophyte and so begins the ritual\nsurgery that will turn him into a superhuman warrior. Here too,\nan aspirant may fail. Thanks to the degeneration of knowledge,\nimplant surgery is heavily ritualised. It is often accompanied by\nscarring, incantation, prayer, fasting, and arcane practices that\nunintentionally compromise medical efficiency.\nOnce a Neophyte begins his training, he severs all links\nwith the world of his birth and begins a life dedicated to the\nEmperor. Once he is deemed ready, he will be taken under\nthe wing of an Initiate and complete his training in the fires\nof battle, where he will either learn or die. When he finally\nbecomes an Initiate himself, he can no longer be considered\nhuman. Any chance for a normal life is gone forever,\nbut though a great and terrible sacrifice, it is\nmade willingly.\nOnce accepted within one of a Crusade’s\nFighting Companies, an Initiate fights and\nhones his craft of death, building his legend\nand forging his hero’s name before one day\ngoing on to train a Neophyte himself. In\nthis way, the experience and wisdom of\nthe Initiates is preserved and passed\non to new recruits.\nThe greatest warriors in a\nFighting Company will be\norganised into the Marshal’s\nhousehold, the equivalent of a\nCodex Chapter’s First Company.\nKnown as the Sword Brethren,\nthese Space Marines are mighty\nheroes whose deeds become part\nof the Chapter’s history.

    "content": "To ascertain who is worthy to join the ranks of the Blood Angels,\nthe youths of the pure Baalite tribes must take part in violent\ngames and magnificent tournaments, battling against both the\nharsh landscape of their home world and, ultimately, each other.\nThe contests are held only once in each generation, at the very\nplace that Sanguinius first came to Baal—Angel’s Fall. Aspirants\nmust reach the so-called Place of Challenge by whatever means\nthey can, a process that weeds out many weaker individuals\nhoping to join the ranks of the Blood Angels. They must race\nacross uncharted miles of hostile, irradiated desert. They must\nleap from the highest cliffs, praying that the primitive assembly\nof wings each bears will save them from sudden death. They\nmust find their way through canyons infested with gigantic,\nmutated beasts. The desiccated husks of previous hopefuls bear\nwitness to those who undertook the trials rashly. Once they\nreach the Place of Challenge, gladiatorial contests, often to the\nvery death, ensure that only the most skilled and determined\nfighters survive.\nOnce fifty or so victors have been separated from the\nunsuccessful aspirants, they will be taken by Thunderhawk\ngunship to fulfil the next stage of their trials. Those who fail\nare nonetheless granted positions of honour when they return\nto their tribes, for the mere fact of their having survived the\ntrials, even if not selected, is a great feat in itself.\nThe successful aspirants are taken to the fortress-monastery\nof the Blood Angels, where they witness sights of such\nmagnificent glory that many are struck down with awe. They\nare taken before the full battle-brethren, and it is here that the\ncontrast between aspirant and Space Marine is truly evident.\nDespite their youth, very few of the aspirants will be untouched\nby the ravages of the blasted lands in which they have lived.\nTheir bodies are riddled with cankers and sores, their faces\nmarred by lesions. In contrast, the towering physiques of the\nSpace Marines around them are the very ideal of perfect beauty,\ntheir skin smooth, their features noble.\nHaving observed a gruelling vigil of three days and three\nnights, the aspirants are led away by the Chapter’s Sanguinary\nPriests, who fulfil not only the role of Apothecary, but of the\nbearers of their primarch’s most sacred blood. Each aspirant\nmust partake of this blood, which is born in a chalice proffered\nto them by a priest. Soon after sipping the precious liquid, the\naspirants fall into a profound sleep and are taken to the Hall\nof Sarcophagi. The walls of this vast, cathedral-like chamber\nare lined with mighty golden caskets, each twice the size of\na man. The sleeping aspirants are entombed within, dwarfed\nby the size of the huge sarcophagi, and attached to an array\nof life-sustaining nodes. There they remain for a full year,\nfed intravenously with nutrients and injected with the Blood\nof Sanguinius.\nAs the aspirants slumber, they are engulfed by vivid and\nstrange dreams depicting the memories of Sanguinius himself.\nThus the very essence of the primarch permeates the minds of\nhis new sons, and ever afterwards these potent emotions and\nmemories will be permanently imprinted upon their souls.\nWhen the aspirants are finally removed from their sarcophagi,\nthey have been changed so thoroughly that few could believe\nthey were once the twisted creatures rescued from the living\nhell of their prior lives. They have become tall, immensely\nstrong, and superhumanly powerful. Their restructured bodies\nhave taken on a haunting beauty reminiscent of their angelic\nforefather, their senses keener, and their muscles stronger\nthan tempered steel. Through this arcane process and lost\ntechnology, the scrofulous wastelander is transformed into a\nbeing of radiant purity and noble purpose.\nthe sons of sanGuinius\nThe Blood Angels are amongst the longest-lived of all of\nthe Space Marine Chapters, their gene-seed granting a vastly\nincreased lifespan on all who possess it. It is not uncommon,\ntherefore, for a Blood Angel to live for a millennium or more, if\ndeath in battle or the Red Thirst does not claim him first. These\nvastly extended life spans allow the Blood Angels to perfect\ntheir techniques in art as well as in war. They have centuries to\nperfect the disciplines to which they turn their minds, and this\naccounts for the fact that Blood Angels’ armour and banners\nare amongst the most ornate ever produced.\nFollowing the example of their primarch, the Blood Angels\nespouse a vision of the galaxy in which the enemies of the\nEmperor can be defeated and mankind can progress to the life\nhe was always fated to live. There is a deeply mystical streak in\nthe Blood Angels’ doctrines, and a strong belief that things can\nbe made better. After all, the Blood Angels are recruited from the\nscrofulous wastelanders of Baal, and if such can be transformed\ninto a tall, proud, and handsome warrior, then there is hope for\nmankind yet. This belief can be seen in everything the Blood\nAngels do. They strive for perfection in all of their endeavours.\nTheir works of art are things of beauty and symmetry. Their\nmartial disciplines are practised unceasingly. Their doctrines are\npermeated with a sense of mortality and the fallen greatness\nof Man.\nThe beatific countenance and noble bearing of the Blood\nAngels is in stark contrast to the curse they bear. While lesser\nwarriors might become morose or fatalistic, weighed down by\nthe inevitability of their fate, the Blood Angels remain stoic.\nThe Blood Angels’ cadre of Sanguinary Priests—the equivalent\nof Apothecaries in other Chapters—tirelessly pursue a cure\nto the Red Thirst. But each year, more and more brethren\nsuccumb to it. Perhaps in an effort to hold the curse at bay,\nmany Blood Angels sleep in the same casket where their bodies\nwere transformed from the ravaged Baalite wastelanders to the\nperfect forms they emerged as, the arcane machinery filtering",

Most of the time, the\nBlood Angels are able to hold their curse in check, but those\nthey engage in assault soon discover the bloodthirsty savagery\nof the sons of Sanguinius.\nBlood Angels are unique amongst the Space Marines in\nthat their gene-seed contains the encoded experience of their\nPrimarch, and most deeply imprinted of all is the memory of\nSanguinius’ final battle with Horus. Sometimes, on the eve of\nbattle, an event or circumstance will trigger this embedded\nmemory and the Battle-Brother’s mind is suddenly wrenched\ninto the distant past. The Black Rage overcomes the Blood\nAngel as the memories and consciousness of Sanguinius intrude\nupon his mind, and dire events ten thousand years old flood\ninto the present.\nA warrior overcome with the Black Rage appears half mad\nwith fury; he is unable to distinguish past from present and does\nnot recognise his comrades.

Instead of the usual dark\ngreen panoply of the rest of the Chapter, the Ravenwing’s bikes and land speeders, as well as their power\narmour, are painted jet black, and it is this which gives the company its unique name. Although the Ravenwing\nis highly specialised formation exceptionally skilled at scouting and assault missions, the company is much\nmore than a reconnaissance force. Its true function is vital to the ten thousand year mission of the Dark Angels.\nAlthough only the company’s highest ranked officers know it, the Ravenwing’s primary role is to hunt down\nand capture the Fallen Dark Angels. Therefore, the members of the Second Company are granted limited\nknowledge of the secrets of the Dark Angels—much more than the Third to Tenth Companies, but far less than\nthe Deathwing and the Inner Circle.",

After passing the trials, many Aspirants\ntake with them the Sacris claymore, an heirloom weapon\ncherished by the tribesmen.

Generally considered clannish and aloof even by other Space Marines, Storm Wardens prefer to remain distant\nfrom the Imperium at large. A Storm Warden is slow to make friends, but esteems and protects those who persevere to\nbecome companions.\nAmongst the Storm Wardens, one’s word is his bond, and honour is paramount. The night before battle is often spent\nin meticulous planning of tactics and strategy, sharing quiet camaraderie amongst their fellow warriors. Many of the most\nsenior Battle-Brothers engage in ritualised duals, the victors gaining a coveted place in the vanguard.\nMost Storm Wardens enjoy debate and crafting points to support their arguments, although some outsiders see these\ntendencies as quarrelsome or insubordinate. However, once a course of action has been agreed upon, a Storm Warden will\nset aside any dispute and carry it out. Perhaps because of their fondness for debate or their own turbulent history, Storm\nWardens have an interest in mysteries and engimas. This curiosity has led more than a few Battle-Brothers to volunteer for\nthe Deathwatch.\nWhen battle begins, Storm Wardens fight with keen fervour, often seeking out an enemy champion or commander to\ntest his skills against.\nKraazgrug’s Folly\nOne of the most famous of the Storm Wardens’ battles took place on the verdant plains of Keffik’s\nWorld in the Scarus Sector. An Ork warband led by Warboss Kraazgrug had been ravaging a number\nof settlements and threatened the food supply for an entire sub-sector. Just before the Orks overran\nthe last of the system’s defences, an astropathic distress signal was relayed to Sacris. In response,\nthe Storm Wardens deployed several companies of Space Marines, supported by many armoured\nvehicles. These forces were under the command of Captain Lorgath Maclir (prior to his ascension to\nthe rank of Chapter Master) and included a handful of Space Marines from the elite First Company.\nMaclir’s plan was to face the Warboss’ trukks and warbuggies on the open plains of the northern\ncontinent. However, the Ork vehicles manoeuvred through the depths of a massive dust storm, and\nMaclir was forced to revise his strategy. Dispatching Scout Bikers, Stormravens, and Land Speeder\nTyphoons, he used his swiftly-moving skirmishing force to lure the main body of the greenskin’s\narmy into a box canyon. The Orks and the warboss were eliminated with an unrelenting salvo of\nheavy weapons fire from the rim of the canyon, and no greenskin left that battlefield alive.\nThe Cleansing of Vigil\nA singularly savage conflict was fought entirely underground in the tunnels beneath the dead world\nof Vigil. In those lightless passages, the Storm Wardens battled metre by bloody metre in a series\nof close-range firefights against the foul Slaugth and their warrior constructs. The cleansing of Vigil\nproved to be a crucial test of the Chapter’s resolve, as the tight quarters of the tunnels precluded\nthe use of heavy armour and the alien forces seemed particularly adept at provoking the Storm\nWardens into abandoning a cautious, methodical approach. The planet was cleansed at last, but at\nthe cost of many veteran Battle-Brothers. The survivors, however, had learned to pay closer heed to\nthe wisdom of the Codex Astartes, and Chapter Master Maclir promoted many of these veterans to\nhis honour guard.",

In this matter, Deathwatch\nApothecaries occupy a uniquely trusted\nposition. Space Marine Chapters\ndo not lightly share the details of\ntheir gene-seed, with its associated traits,\nvariations, and even mutations. Deathwatch\nApothecaries are sworn to maintain the secrets of\neach of the Chapters from which their fellows\nare drawn, an oath that carries the harshest of\npenalties should it ever be broken.\nAside from monitoring the state of the\nSpace Marines’ implants, the Apothecaries\nmust also be ever alert to the risk of alien\ncontamination. Whilst undertaking their\nmissions, the Deathwatch Kill-teams\nare likely to come into contact not only\nwith creatures of utterly alien biology,\nbut with all the bacterial life that\naccompanies them. While the Space Marines are blessed with\nthe very strongest of immune systems, it is known that the spores\nof some alien life forms can cause mutation or death even in the\nAdeptus Astartes. There are some xenos that actually reproduce\nin this vile manner, their seed infecting the victim and slowly\nmutating him into the original life form. Such blasphemy must\nbe guarded against, and the Apothecaries administer an entire\nbank of tests on every member of a Kill-team before and after\nevery mission.\nAnother area in which the Deathwatch Apothecaries are\nhighly involved is that of training. Deathwatch Kill-teams\npush their bodies to, and beyond, the limits even of their\nunique physiology, and the Apothecaries must monitor this\nprocess closely. But they are a part of the training too, for the\nApothecaries often aid the Watch Captains in formulating the\nmost arduous of training regimens. Using his unique knowledge\nof his charges, the Apothecary can induce various states in his\nBattle-Brothers, under which their skills and strengths will\nbe tested all the further. Interfacing remotely with a Battlelimit blood oxygen levels or simulate the effects of any number\nof poisons, all in the cause of maintaining combat readiness.\nIn battle, an Apothecary carries a number of specialised\nitems of equipment, integrating a variety of tools into a single,\nwrist-mounted unit. The Apothecary may\nhave crafted many of these himself\naccording to his own needs. He uses\na high-powered laser scalpel or an\nadamantine-toothed chainsaw to cut\naway ruined armour so that he can\ntreat a Battle-Brother’s wounds,\nand he administers the panacea of\ndrugs stored within the unit using\nlong syringes.",

Many\nare taught the names of the greatest heroes, and celebrate their greatest deeds, as\nproclaimed from countless millions of pulpits across the entire Imperium.\nYet, very few will ever see a Space Marine, for their numbers are so few compared\nto the great, seething mass of humanity. Only when war comes to his world, and\nwith it the hosts of the Imperium’s armies, will a common man have any chance\nof setting eyes upon a Space Marine, let alone conversing with him.\nMost common men who do have cause to interact with a Space Marine are likely\nto hold him such awe that he may lose the power of words. At the very least,\na Space Marine will be regarded and addressed with great deference, even the\nhighest-ranking officials bowing their head to the Battle-Brother. As well they\nshould, for the very fact that a Space Marine has come to their world is sure sign\nthat the enemies of the Emperor are abroad, and only his strength and bravery\nwill hold them at bay.\nThe manner in which Space Marines are wont to interact with common Humanity\nvaries enormously, but most are aloof, so dedicated to their own mission, their\nvery nature so apart from what they once were, that they have little in common\nwith ordinary people. Most Space Marines care only for the traditions of their\nChapter and the task of defeating the Emperor’s enemies, and know so little\nof the trivial cares of normal life that very little common ground exists. Even\nwhen interacting with a mighty warrior, perhaps a decorated veteran Imperial\nGuardsman, so total is the Space Marine’s dedication to his duty that few can live\nup to his standards. It is rare indeed for a normal man to be regarded by a Space\nMarine as an equal. Only the greatest of the Imperium’s heroes—men such as the\nLord Solar Macharius —have earned such an honour of counting amongst their\nfriends one or more Space Marines of the Adeptus Astartes.",

Within each Watch Fortress is to be found the\nsealed Vault which stores weapons and relics too dangerous\nto be allowed to fall into the hands of Mankind’s enemies.\nAlso within the Vault is an archive of forbidden knowledge—\nmultiple stasis chambers contain ancient tomes, engraved\ntablets, data-crystals, and mnemonic banks. Not even the\nWatch Commander has access to these archives—only the\nLibrarians are entrusted with their access codes, and only they\nare judged strong enough to withstand the sanity shattering\nsecrets sealed within. It is only in the direst of circumstances\nthat a Librarian will enter the Vault archive, for each time he\ndoes so he is exposed to the whispering voices of long-dead\nalien beings, tempting him with the power to rule the whole\nof Humanity in the name of ancient and blasphemous gods.\nNevertheless, so terrible are many of the horrors faced by the\nDeathwatch that the Librarian may be required to consult\nthe archives in order to discover some previous record of an\nenemy’s weakness. Such knowledge can spell the difference\nbetween a mission’s success and failure.\nAnother role carried out by a Watch Fortress’s Librarians is\nthat of providing the Watch Commander with counsel. Given\ntheir access to forbidden knowledge and their innate\nunderstanding of arcane matters, the word of a\nLibrarian rarely goes unheeded in the Watch\nCommander’s plans. In addition to this,\nmany Librarians are gifted with some\ndegree of prognostication—whether\nby way of visions,\nm e d i t a t i o n ,",

Some of these, such as the Chaplains, are part of the establishment of a specific company, while\nothers, such as the Techmarines, are part of a separate body within the Chapter, and attached to a battle force\nas required.\nChaplains are mighty warriors and truly inspirational leaders. Their duty is to tend to the spiritual welfare of\nthe brethren, on and off of the battlefield. Many of the sights a Space Marine must witness and many of the fell\nbeings he must face are so infernal that the soul of an ordinary man would be seared to ashes. The ministrations\nof the Chaplains ensure that Space Marines remain pure of heart, armouring their souls with unshakable faith.\nJust as the Chaplains see to the spiritual well being of the Battle-Brothers, so the Apothecaries look to their\nbodily health. These warriors would give their last drop of blood that a Space Marine might continue to fight,\nand they are able to heal the most grievous of battlefield injuries. The Apothecaries are assigned the most sacred\nof duties, that of recovering the gene-seed of a fallen Battle-Brother, so that the Chapter’s genetic future might\nbe ensured and his memory lives on in the inheritance of future generations of Space Marines.\nFor the mightiest heroes of a Chapter, even death does not spell the end of service. Even if a Space Marine’s body\nis crippled so utterly that no hope of healing exists, his broken form may be interred into the ceramite sarcophagus\nof a Dreadnought, where his will drives a towering engine of destruction. Such heroes are mightily revered by the\nSpace Marines, and the Battle-Brother’s words and deeds are the very stuff of Chapter legend.\nThose Neophytes who show an affinity for the workings of the machine are assigned to the Forge, where\nthey undergo extensive training in the mastery of all of the Chapter’s weaponry and vehicles. These so-called\nTechmarines are dispatched to Mars, where they are inducted into the secrets of the Cult Mechanicus by the techengines of war.\nRank 6 Deathwatch Librarian Advances",

To this end, the\nTactical Marines are masters of a wide range of\ncombat tactics, and they are adept in the use of a\nvariety of weapons and other equipment.\nThe most commonly fielded weapon\namongst the Deathwatch Tactical Marines\nis the bolter, but this is not the standard\nissue weapon carried by other Chapters.\nAlmost every boltgun in the arsenal of\nthe Deathwatch has been crafted to\nthe very highest possible standard, and\nmaintained according to the strictest\nregimes. They are invariably fitted with a device called a\nshot selector, which allows the brother to quickly chamber\none of the many specialised types of bolter ammunition\nthat the Deathwatch utilises, and engage any foe that may\npresent itself.\nIt is the use of this specialised ammunition that makes the\nDeathwatch Tactical Marine such a fearsome and highly flexible\nwarrior. Hellfire rounds for example, have been introduced\nfollowing the lessons learned in costly battles against Hive\nFleet Behemoth, each containing a small payload of mutogenic\nacid that is devastating to organic matter. Dragonfire rounds\nexplode on contact with their foe, erupting in a burst of\nincandescent chemical fire that soon engulfs the target.\nKraken rounds contain a super-dense core that affords them\nimproved range and penetration compared to a conventional\nround, making them ideal against heavily armoured targets.\nMetal Storm rounds are examples of highly sophisticated and\nbarely understood technology, a miniscule proximity detector\ntriggering the round’s detonation microseconds before impact,\nand lacerating the foe with thousands of razor-sharp fragments,\ncausing him to bleed out in seconds. Stalker shells are optimised\nfor range and stealth, allowing a Tactical Marine to use his\nbolter as a makeshift sniper rifle, increasing his flexibility and\nlethality still further.\nThis huge range of ammunition types means that the\nDeathwatch Tactical Marine can face a wide range of foes,\nand the shot selector allows him to switch, even in the heat of\nbattle, from one to the next. Some Tactical Marines,\nhowever, choose to specialise instead of\ntaking this all-round approach. It is\nnot uncommon for one of a Killspecial weapon, such as\na flamer or meltagun\ninto combat.

After all, a\nbolter not cleaned, oiled, blessed,\nand beseeched can scarcely be\nexpected to be reliable in battle,\nand so a Space Marine’s life may\ndepend upon how well such weapons\nare maintained. Techmarines oversee this\nprocess, guiding the battle brothers in the\ncorrect and proper rituals by which the\nwar spirit of each and every weapon is\nappeased.\nOn the battlefield, a Techmarine’s primary role is to effect\nrepairs of damaged equipment, so that it may return to the fight.\nEach Techmarine carries a huge range of highly specialised\nand often arcane tools, sometimes mounted on a servo-arm or\nat the end of a prehensile mechadendrite. With these tools, the\nTechmarine can repair virtually any item of equipment, from\nan overheated plasma pistol to an immobilised Land Raider,\nprovided that some spark of the machine spirit’s essence remains.\nMany battles have been won thanks to a Techmarine recovering\na damaged weapon in this manner, and in their own way they are\noften vital to a mission’s success.\nAlthough many of the weapons carried by Space Marines are\nwonders of technology beyond the dreams of normal men, there\nare some machines that are so exceptional that only a Techmarine\nmay attend them. One of the most unusual of these is the conversion\nbeamer, a rare weapon that works by converting matter to energy\nin a beam that becomes stronger the further it extends and the\nmore matter is converted. It is only by the constant ministrations of\na Techmarine that such a weapon can be utilised—should anyone\nelse attempt to use the weapon, its war spirit might become greatly\nangered and turn its ire upon the wielder instead.\nThere are yet more weapons and items of equipment even\nmore exotic than the conversion beamer. Many are unique,\nand all are sealed within the Vault at the heart of\neach Watch Fortress. Just as the Librarian has\nexclusive access to the reams of forbidden\nknowledge in each of these archives,\nso the Deathwatch Techmarine keeps\nhis portion of the Vault sealed to all\nbut his fellow Techmarines.

    "content": "“Ability is not enough. Dedication is not enough. Even victory is\nnot enough. To become one of our number, you must embody all of\nthese, and yet be more still. What that more is I cannot tell you. Find\nthe answer in your bones, in your heart and soul, and you will be a\nwarrior.”\n–from an address to the 10th Company by Cadmus\nGracchus, Imperial Fists Chaplain\nTalents are special abilities and proficiencies that a character\npossesses either through his intrinsic nature or through the\napplication of well-practised experience. This is in contrast to\nSkills, which represent abilities gained by learning or training.\nA Talent is an ability that a character is either capable of or\nis not, whereas a Skill is something that he can be better at\nby degrees. When a Battle-Brother smites an enemy with a\ndevastating blow with his thunder hammer heedless of the\ndanger to himself, smashes aside dozens of lesser foes, and\ncalls for vengeance for his fallen brother, he is using Talents.\nThe battlefields of the 41st Millennium are unforgiving. From\nbreaking a horde of Tyranids to sabotaging a Tau shield\ngenerator; a Battle-Brother will need every edge that his\nTalents provide him with.\nTalents differ from Skills in that a player need not use an\nAction or Test to utilise the ability. They are always in effect,\nand many Talents give bonuses to Tests or allow Actions not\navailable to the common man.\nPlanning out effective and flavourful combinations of\nTalents and Skills that match the character’s background\ncan be an enjoyable process for the entire game group, and\ncan provide interesting ideas for the GM or other players to\nfurther cement their relationships and adversaries.",

Similar,\npersonalised designs exist, all using unbreakable materials to\nform an impressive cloak. Each one is the labour of decades\nby master artificers, who temper each individual scale and\nthread for maximum resilience. Their work is then blessed\nby Chaplains before finally being laid upon the shoulders of\nits first bearer. The mantle protects him not just through its\nphysical strength, but also by making his movements more\ndifficult to predict as the opaque cloak whirls about him in\ncombat.\nAn adamantine mantle negates 2 points of Armour\nPenetration from any incoming attack. The wearer gains a\n+10 to his Opposed Weapon Skill Test to Feint, and if he\ntakes the Defensive Stance Action, foes suffer an additional\n–10 on Weapon Skill Tests to attack him.",

Cluster\nmines achieve this aim by packing triple-intensity fyceline or\nsimilarly potent explosives into dozens of micro-explosive nodules\nthat are linked to a single trigger, typically a tripwire or pressure\nsensor. The networked explosives have a synergistic effect and\nproduce a massive blast when detonated.\nA standard mine array covers two square metres; this can be\nincreased by linking multiple mine arrays, but the area’s smallest\ndimension must not be less than one metre for the mines to have\ntheir full effect. Cluster mines are designed for even the relatively\ngreen Scout squads to plant without extensive training. When\nsetting cluster mines, the character makes a Concealment Test,\nreceiving a +20 bonus if he is also trained in Demolitions. Note\nthe degrees of success, as any character about to pass through a\nmined area Opposes those successes with an Awareness Test. If\nthe potential victim wins the contest, he may stop short to avoid\nthe mines. If he fails, he and anyone else in the mined area take\n4d10 X Damage with a Penetration of 4.\nA successful Demolitions Test while planting mines allows for\nmore sophisticated trigger techniques such as time-delays.

Depending on how much energy the psyker used,\nthere may also be unforeseen consequences. The step-by-step\nprocess for using a Psychic Power is described below.\n• Choose the Power Level (Fettered, Unfettered or\nPush): The power level at which the psyker uses his\npower (reflecting how deeply he is drawing from the\nWarp) influences the likelihood of the psyker successfully\nmanifesting the power, and also determines whether\nthere are any unwanted side effects such as Psychic\nPhenomena.\n• Make a Focus Power Test: This is a Willpower Test, the\ndifficulty of which depends on the power level chosen. In\nsome cases, the target may Oppose this test (see page 203\nfor Opposed Tests). Whether or not a Focus Power Test\nis an Opposed Test is noted in the power description.\n• Apply the Effects: Depending on the psyker’s final Psy",

In extreme cases, these\ndisturbances may even lead to the opening an uncontrolled\nrift between reality and warp space with potentially fatal\nconsequences. By minimising the amount of power he draws,\na psyker can reduce or eliminate the chance of side effects\nsuch as Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp (see pages\n187-188). Equally, he can draw deeper from the well of the\nWarp to boost his powers beyond his normal capabilities.\nOf course, such power always comes with a greater risk of\nunleashing unintended effects or even summoning unwanted\nvisitors from the beyond.\nWhen a psyker uses a power, he has a choice of using it at\nthree different levels:\n• Fettered: The psyker holds back his full power and\ncarefully channels energy from the Warp, hopefully using\njust enough to manifest the psychic power but not enough\nto trigger unnatural or dangerous effects.

The Vortex lasts for 1d5 Rounds and then vanishes.\n83–86\nLost to the Warp: The psyker must make an immediate Very Hard (–30) Willpower Test. If he fails, he is\nimmediately dragged into the Warp by a Daemon, which possesses him and uses his body for vile purposes. The\npsyker appears on an inhabited planet 1d10 weeks later with dim memories of the horrific acts he has performed while\npossessed. He gains 4d10 Corruption Points, and may experience complications caused by his actions while possessed.\nHe may receive a visit from the Inquisition if his fate becomes known to that organisation. From now on, the psyker\nmust adjust all Perils of the Warp checks by +10 due to his body serving as a conduit for blasphemous forces.\n87–90\nReality Quake: Reality buckles around the psyker, and an area within 3d10 metres of him is sundered. Solid objects\nalternately rot, burn, and freeze, and everyone and everything in the area takes 2d10 Rending damage. Warded objects\nand Untouchables suffer half the damage rolled.\n91–99\nSomething is Coming...: With a blood curdling howl, a Daemon Prince (see Chapter XIII: Adversaries) rips into\nexistence within 3d10 metres of the psyker. It detests the psyker and trains its attacks on the fool that unwittingly\nsummoned it. Only its destruction or the death of the psyker will send it back to the Warp.",

The briefing allows the players to get an idea\nof the kind of things they will be facing and the kind of tasks\nthey will be required to complete. With this information, they\ncan prepare themselves accordingly by choosing appropriate\nweaponry and armour or undertaking additional training.\nSelecting a Leader: At the start of every Mission, the\nplayers must select a Battle-Brother to lead their squad and act\nas its commander for the duration of their combat assignment.\nThere are a number of ways this leader can be chosen, but\nultimately the choice rests with the players. It is the leader’s job\nto make command decisions during the Mission and break the\ndeadlock should the Kill-team become divided in its choice of\nhow best to proceed. The choice of leader will also determine\nwhich oaths the Kill-team may take.\nOath-taking: Before every battle Space Marines take\noaths to their Chapter, their Primarch, the Deathwatch, and\nthe Emperor.

Because a Space Marine’s equipment\nis provided by his Chapter, he has access to a great range of\nsome of the most destructive and potent weaponry known\nto the Imperium.

When formulating a Mission\nBriefing, the GM should be careful only to give the players\ninformation that they would be likely to have, which could be\ncomplete and comprehensive or vague and sketchy depending\non the kind of Mission they are undertaking. In either case,\na Mission Briefing does not need to be exhaustive and can\nbe as simple as “go here, kill this.” The important part of this\nstep is that it lets the players know that orders have come\ndown directing them to do the work of the Emperor and\nthe Chapter.\nAlternatively if the players are working on their own\nrecognisance and setting their own mission objectives (as\ncan happen in the field), the briefing might be a request\nfor intelligence on their targets. The GM can then proceed\nmuch in the same way as if these were direct orders from the\nKill-team’s commander—be it the Chapter Master, an Ordo\nInquisitor, or other ranking member of the Imperium—and\nlay out an overview of the Mission and define any or all current\nobjectives.

This can be either at the start of the leader’s turn as a\nFree Action, or at any point by the leader as a Reaction.\nIn addition to these advantages the GM can also designate\nthe leader to carry any special mission-specific equipment or\nintelligence. So for instance, if the Mission required special pass\ncodes, or an experimental auspex scanner, the leader is typically\nentrusted with such items.\noaTh-Taking\nThe Adeptus Astartes hold their oaths to their Primarch, the\nEmperor, and their brothers above all other things in the\ngalaxy.

Oaths can come in many forms, and different\nBattle-Brothers may make different oaths before a battle\ndepending on their focus for that Mission.\nBefore embarking on a Mission, the players may choose\none oath for their Kill-team which will last for the duration\nof the Mission. All oaths have a prerequisite Career Path and\nmay only be chosen by the Kill-team if their current leader\nmeets this requirement.

In addition to\nforcing the players to adapt to difficult situations and think\non their feet, complications also increase the difficulty of a\nmission and as a result the rewards the players gain from it.\nHere are 10 typical complications that the GM can use to\nalter the nature of his missions, though he should feel free\nto come up with more of his own.

Ultimately,\nthis comes down to a judgement call on the GM’s part, based\non the circumstances and the Actions of the various combatants\nleading up to the encounter. The GM should take the following\ninto account when determining Surprise:\n• Is anyone hiding? Successful use of the Concealment Skill\nbefore the combat may mean that some combatants are\nhidden. Extremely wary characters may oppose this with an\nAwareness Test.\n• Is anyone sneaky? Successful use of the Silent Move Skill\nmay have positioned some characters for an ambush. Again,\nwary opponents may oppose this with an Awareness Test.\n• Are there any unusual circumstances that would mask the\napproach of attackers? This can cover nearly anything, from\npouring rain to whining engines to nearby explosions.\n• Are there any distractions? It’s possible that something quite\ndistracting is going on. A cultist’s attention may be so fixated\non the sermon of his confessor that he doesn’t notice his\nattackers approaching.\nBearing all of this in mind, the GM must decide which\ncombatants are Surprised. Whilst it’s often the case that one\nentire side or the other is Surprised, there can be individual\nexceptions. For example, mutants may easily Surprise a unit of\ngreen Guardsmen, but not their keen-eyed commissar. If no one is\nSurprised, proceed with the combat as normal.\nA Surprised character loses his Turn in the first Round. He\ncan do nothing except stand dumbfounded.

The GM can accomplish this by sketching out\nsimple overhead maps on paper. Many game stores also\nsell large game mats that you can draw on with wet-erase\nmarkers. These mats are usually pre-printed with squares\ngrids or hex patterns to make measuring distances quick\nand easy. Tactical combat maps can be drawn to any scale,\nand some roleplayers like to combine large-scale maps with\nminiatures where a one inch square represents one square\nmeter. While tactical combat maps can be very useful, they\nare not necessary to play Deathwatch. Many roleplayers\nprefer to use rich narrative descriptions to allow fellow\nplayers to simply imagine all the action. This requires\nplayers to keep a snapshot of the relative positions of all\ncombatants in their heads, but it also allows for greater\nfreedom in detailing the events of a combat.",

    "content": "Instead of inflicting Damage with an unarmed attack, a\ncharacter can attempt to Grapple his opponent. Attempting\na Grapple is a melee attack that uses either a Charge Action\nor a Standard Attack Action. The attacker makes a Weapon\nSkill Test as normal. The target of the Grapple may use a\nReaction, if able, to avoid the attack. If the attack is successful,\nthe attacker and the target are Grappling, with the attacker\ncontrolling the Grapple. The controller of the Grapple can\nend it any time as a Free Action.\nIn a Grapple, all of the following apply:\n• Participants in a Grapple cannot use Reactions.\n• Participants in a Grapple are considered to be engaged\nin melee combat.\n• Participants in a Grapple can only use the Grapple Action\n(see page 240).\n• As a Free Action, the controller of the Grapple can\nvoluntarily end the Grapple on his Turn.\n• Other attackers gain a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests\nto hit any target engaged in a Grapple.\nOnly two characters can be engaged in the same Grapple,\nbut up to two other characters can lend Assistance to each\nGrappler in certain situations. See the Grapple Action on page\n240 for details.\ntwo-weapon FIghtIng\nMany warriors fight with a weapon in either hand. There are\nadvantages and disadvantages to this style of fighting. While it\noffers some improved opportunities to make attacks, it reduces\nthe chances of successfully striking a target. Unless a two-weapon\nfighter has the Ambidextrous Talent, it is important to consider\nwhich hand is his primary hand and which is his secondary hand;\nplayers should have these details noted on their Battle-Brothers’\ncharacter sheets. The following apply when a character is fighting\nwith two weapons:\n• The character may use any melee weapons or ranged weapons\nthat can be reasonably used in one hand.\n• The character may use either hand to make an attack. Attacks\nmade using the character’s secondary hand suffer a –20\npenalty to Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Tests.\n• If the character has the Two-Weapon Wielder talent, he may\nuse the Multiple Attacks combat Action to attack with both\nweapons, but each suffers a –20 penalty to the Weapon Skill\nor Ballistic Skill Test. If the character has the Ambidextrous\nTalent, these penalties drop to –10.\n• If the character is wielding at least one melee weapon, he\nmay perform a Parry Reaction once each Round as normal\nwith this weapon, though he still may not Parry more than\nonce in a Round. This Weapon Skill Test is not an attack, and\ntherefore it does suffer the standard penalty for attacks made\nusing a secondary hand.\n• If a character with the Two-Weapon Wielder Talent is armed\nwith a melee weapon in one hand and a pistol in the other,\nhe may attack with both whilst engaged in melee combat\nusing the Multiple Attacks combat action. Resolve each\nattack separately by testing Weapon Skill for the melee\nweapon and Ballistic Skill for the pistol.\n• When firing a ranged weapon with each hand, the character\nmay fire each weapon on a different mode, for example, one\non full automatic and one on semi-automatic. When firing a\nfull automatic weapon in each hand, the character may only\nlay down one area of Suppressive Fire.\n• The character may fire two weapons at different targets,\nthough the targets must be within 10 metres of each other.",

Unlike a\nfilm, however, a roleplaying game is a collaborative effort between\nplayers and Game Master, and while the GM may set the scene, it\nthen falls to the players to decide the actions of their characters.\nThis is where the other key role of the GM comes into play.\nIn addition to being the director and storyteller of the game, he\nis also its referee. As a game, Deathwatch uses rules to adjudicate\nthe actions of the characters and determine their success in many\nof their endeavours. The GM helps to decide when and where\nthese rules are used and also how they are interpreted, making\nsure that the game runs as smoothly as possible. It is the Game\nMaster’s job to be fair and impartial, like any referee, and ensure\nthat everyone is having a good time.\nBecause the GM sets the scene and describes the action, he\nalso creates the story or plot that the players follow. In roleplaying\ngames these plots are commonly known as adventures or scenarios.\nEverything the players know or want to know about their world\nis described by the GM, and he also takes the part of the other\ninhabitants of the universe, from the lowliest Imperial Guardsman\nto the most powerful Sector Lord, deciding how they react to the\ncharacters and the actions they take within the adventure.\nWhile at first glance the GM has a lot more work than the\nplayers, his job can also be one of the most rewarding, as he gets\nthe satisfaction of bringing enjoyment to the players and seeing\nhis stories come to life.",

    "content": "Since it is the role of the GM to shape and lead the story, he\nneeds to be more prepared than the other players. Before the\nGM accepts the mantle of running the game, there are three\nkey things he should consider.\nKnow the Rules: It is important that the GM know the\nrules better than, or at least as well as, the other players. This\nmeans that the GM should read as much of this book as\npossible before he runs his first game. Chapter VII: Playing\nthe Game is particularly relevant as these are the core\nmechanics of the game and are fundamental to its workings.\nKnowing the rules is also important for the GM as he is\nrequired to make judgments and adjudications on the actions\nof the characters. Helping the Game Master in this area is\nwhat the rules are designed to do.\nKnow the Plot: In a roleplaying game, the players and\ntheir characters are the heroes confronting the dark and\nforbidding universe of the 41st millennium. However, it is\nthe Game Master who creates the plot that they follow and\nchooSing thE gm\nWhen organising a game of Deathwatch, one player needs\nto be nominated as the GM. It is always a good idea if the\nGM volunteers for the job, as the game will be better if the\nperson running it is enthusiastic about what he is doing.\nUsually, however, the Game Master is decided before the\nplayers get together for their first session, as the role of the\nGM taken up by the person that has organised the game\nin the first place—probably also the person that bought\nthis book. It is also common that over time several of the\ngroup’s players may take on the role of the GM, sharing\nthe work and creating their own adventures. This allows\nplayers a chance to make their own stories and can be very\nrewarding as GMs tag-team adventures leading to plots\nand campaigns with more depth and detail.\nDElEgating to PlayERS\nThere is little doubt that the Game Master has the lion’s\nshare of the work when it comes to running aroleplaying\ngame. He does not need to do all the work, however, when\nit comes to organising the adventure and getting together\nall of the ingredients for a successful game. This is where\nsome of the players can also help out, doing such things as\nbringing miniatures, dice, pencils and paper, or snacks.\nThe most important contribution players can make to\na game is in helping the GM to add detail and depth to\nhis setting. For example, rather than the GM creating the\ndetails of the Battle of the Grey March, an important part\nof a PC’s background, he could ask the player to write up\na little about it. This means that the player is adding to the\nworld and the GM also has some extra detail that he can\nadd into one of his plots later. These are also the kinds of\ntasks that players really enjoy. By allowing them to create\nthese kinds of background details, the GM’s task is made\neasier and the group’s adventures made richer.",

However, as with all aspects of the\nWarhammer 40,000 universe, there are many different paths,\nthemes, and settings that can be explored and enjoyed. These\ncan range from anything from a simple search-and-destroy\nmission involving the extermination of a powerful foe, or a\ndaring rescue in the midst of a full-scale planetary invasion,\nto a secret Inquisitorial assignment where both objectives and\nenemies are unclear, or a volatile diplomatic mission to an\nalien world where the Battle-Brothers must do everything\nthey can to avoid bloodshed.\nBeing a Space Marine is more than simply being a potent\nand fearless warrior—it is also about protecting the Imperium\nand the rule of the Emperor wherever and however that may\ncome about.\nsTyles of Play\nThere are a number of styles of play that lend themselves to\nDeathwatch and focus on the different kinds of adventures\nthe Game Master might like to run. None of these styles is\nexclusive of course, and they can be mixed and matched as\nrequired by the GM’s plot.\nthE EmPERoR’S finESt\nSpace Marines are, by their nature and design, most commonly\nfound where the fighting is the thickest. Bred for war and\ntrained to excel in all aspects of battle, Battle-Brothers fit\neasily into adventures that focus on lots of combat. These\noften take the form of military missions where the characters\nfind themselves sent in to destroy targets, complete objectives,\nand bring glory to the Emperor by vanquishing his foes. While\nthere are many permutations and variations on the military\ntheme and the idea of an elite group of warriors tasked with\nspecial orders, they all share the common goal of annihilating\nthe enemy, usually in a hail of bolter shells and plasma bolts.\nMilitary-themed games also often focus on single actions and\nobjectives in the greater scheme of Imperial strategy. While\nthe Imperial battlefleet rains orbital barrages from above and\nthe Imperial Guard swarm across the blasted landscape, the\nDeathwatch Kill-team moves between the flames and shadows\nto strike at critical times and places. Against a backdrop of\nash, blood, and ruin, the Battle-Brothers wade through the\ncarnage aloof and elite, aware of their unique role in the tide\nof battle. Such games can also see the characters swept up\nin ongoing Imperial campaigns and dispatched from world\nto world or warzone to warzone at the whim of unseen\ncommanders and battle-hungry generals. This could see them\nstorming a lunar defence platform, followed by a low-orbit\ninsertion into a jungle warzone before being conveyed by\nThunderhawk gunship to a beach landing on the other side\nof the planet.\nThe advantage of military-style games is that they are easy\nto start and finish, existing only within the parameters of the\nmission and with the benefit of the Imperial war machine to\nferry, supply, and brief the characters without the need for\nthem to find their own way around the galaxy or shop for\nreplacement weapons or ammo.\nIdeas and concepts for military-style missions and more\ndetail on the Battle-Brothers’ role within the Imperial War\nMachine can be found in Creating Missions on page 272.",

Games that feature the involvement of\nthe Inquisition are likely to be more subtle and detailed than\nthose in which the Kill-team is facing the foes of humanity\nin open battle. This can mean accompanying an Inquisitor\nand his servants into the depths of a hive world, some ancient\nand forgotten alien ruins, or the shadowy corridors of a space\nhulk, far from the support of the Imperial armies, where the\nKill-team must rely upon their own skills to survive and\nprotect their allies.

A rough guideline for what\nkinds of deeds and achievements merit such an honour\nare listed below:\n• Destroyed a potent and powerful threat single• Performed a deed that significantly altered the\noutcome of a battle (i.e., held the bridge alone\nagainst a horde, eliminated the enemy leader in\nsingle combat, etc.).\n• Reached a high level of achievement with\nhonour and courage (i.e., carried the Company\nBanner through twelve engagements, served with\ndistinction for six decades, etc.).\n• Completed an important objective critical to the\nmission single-handedly.\n• Rescued or saved the entire Kill-team from a\ndeadly threat.\nThe decision to award an honour is normally at\nthe GM’s discretion.

Assault\nObjectives are best resolved with extreme violence and the\napplication of heavy firepower—fortunately, something most\nKill-teams have in spades.\nDefence: Battle-Brothers are not always on the attack and\nsometimes they must hold their ground, usually while heavily\noutnumbered and without support. Defence Objectives focus on\nprotecting a place, person, or even an ideal, be it with blazing\nbolters or a resolute will.\nRecon: Intelligence gathering is a vital part of any Mission\nand can mark the difference between success and failure. Recon\nObjectives revolve around procuring information, such as the\nlocation of an enemy stronghold or the code to opening an\nancient xenos device.\nDaemonic: Greatest of the enemies of mankind are those\nthat exist beyond the veil of the immaterium, watching, waiting,\nand hungering for human souls. Daemonic Objectives involve a\nlarge degree of daemonic influence, either in the form of warpXenos: It is the duty of the Deathwatch to deal with any alien\nthat would soil the Emperor’s domain with its presence. Xenos\nObjectives contain a significant alien element and often require\nthe Kill-team to go toe-to-toe with such terrifying monsters as\nTyranid hive tyrants or Ork warlords.\nThe GM can set Objective themes as he sees appropriate\nwhen establishing his Mission Objectives. Note, however, that\nnot all Objectives require a theme, while some may have two or\nmore depending on its major elements.",

    "content": "“The warp is a strange and terrible place. You might as well throw a\ntraveller into a sea of sharks and tell him to swim home as send him\nthrough the warp unprotected. Better it is not to let common man\ntravel through the stars. Better still, let him not know such a thing\nis feasible.”\n–Fra Safrane, 5th aide to Navigator De’el.\nThe reason why the spacecraft of the Imperium can move quickly\nover the entire galaxy, while other races suffer more restricted and\nslower spaceflight, is a combination of three factors. The first is the\nmaintenance of ancient technology by the Adeptus Mechanicus,\nthe Tech-Priests of Mars who preserve the lore of ancient science\non behalf of the Adeptus Terra. Without the technological\nadvantage of efficient warp engines, it would be impossible for\nthe Imperium to defend its scattered planets. The second factor is\nthe existence of human mutants known as Navigators, a race apart\nwhich traces its origins to the uncertain times of the Dark Age of\nTechnology. Only a Navigator can pilot a ship within warp space.\nHis swollen cranium houses a mind which is sensitive to the tides\nand currents of the warp, enabling him to guide his ship through\nwarp space to its eventual destination. Other races must rely upon\nguesswork and endless corrective manoeuvres to travel even short\ndistances through the warp. The third factor which makes warp\ntravel possible is the immeasurably powerful psychic beacon called\nthe Astronomican. Broadcast by a choir of psykers from Terra, the\nAstronomican reaches out through warp space, guiding spacecraft\nto their destination. Only a Navigator can sense the guiding light\nof the Astronomican, and only he can follow its psychic signal. It\nis the Astronomican which allows a Navigator to use his powers\nto the fullest; without it, not even the most powerful Navigator\ncould pilot his ship over the immense distances which separate\nthe worlds of the Imperium.\nWarp space is an alternate dimension composed of energy, as\nopposed to the physical space of the material universe. There are\nhazards within the warp which can wreck spacecraft and carry\nthem off course: unexpected turbulence, warp storms, and loops\nthat can trap a ship for eternity. These perils, though considerable,\nare nothing compared to the greater and unimaginable dangers\nthat lurk in warp space.\nWarp space is composed entirely of psychic energy. It is\nthis psychic energy that a human psyker draws upon to use his\npowers: to send telepathic messages hurtling through the warp\nfrom world to world, or to propel a psychic bolt of energy against\na foe. Warp space is not empty but inhabited by many strange and\ndangerous creatures, the most dangerous of which are the Great\nGods of Chaos and their legions of daemons.\nDaemons lust after the flesh and blood of living creatures. They\nwant only to destroy Mankind, to drag the souls of men back\nto their shadowy realm, to obliterate the material universe and\nengulf it within the energy of warp space. Fortunately, daemons\ncannot exist for long in the material universe and they need to\nfind psychic gateways in order to leave the warp. Such gateways\nexist, but they are rare. The most vulnerable gateways of all are\nthe minds of psykers. A psyker’s powers open up a path between\nreality and the warp, a path which a daemon may find and follow\nstraight to the mind of the psyker himself.",

    "content": "“On this world, my word shall be heeded as that of the Emperor. The\nsouls of my subjects belong to Him, but their bodies belong to me.”\n–King Lamok, Imperial Commander and ruler of Woebetide\nThe vast majority of the Imperium’s worlds are ruled by\nan individual called an Imperial Commander or Imperial\nGovernor. Those that are not are most likely to fall under the\ndirect control of one of the Imperium’s organisations, such as\nthe Space Marines or the Adeptus Mechanicus, and in such\ncases a senior member of that organisation holds the additional\nrank of Imperial Commander.\nEach world in the Imperium is, to all intents and purposes,\nautonomous. Of course, this self-rule is subject to various\nconditions, the greatest of which is that its leader renders due\ntithes to the Imperium, in the form of resources and military\nunits, and maintains a strict cull of its psyker population.\nBeyond these responsibilities, planets are largely free to\nadminister themselves as they see fit.\nAlthough every planet has an individual who holds the\nrank of Imperial Commander, the exact form of governance\nvaries enormously. On most worlds, the Imperial Commander\nhas inherited the title from a long line of predecessors, perhaps\nbeing able to trace the lineage back to the world’s first colonists,\nliberators or conquerors. Other planets are ruled by a council,\nthe chair of which holds the rank of Imperial Commander so\nlong as he presides. On a small number of worlds the populace\ndecides who will rule them, though such regimes rarely survive\nin the age of war that is the 41st Millennium.\nAlthough each world is effectively independent, the\nImperium is divided up into sectors and sub-sectors. The\nworlds of these regions are often interdependent to some\ndegree. For example densely populated Hive worlds rely\non nearby agricultural worlds to feed their populations.\nEven if not directly dependent, there exists some manner\nof federation, for the benefit of trade and mutual defence,\nwhich is normally presided over by a Sector Lord, a powerful\nindividual appointed by the Adeptus Terra. Sector Lords do\nnot have direct control over Imperial Commanders and their\nworlds, but they do have a lot of control over trade and other\nmatters affecting how the world interacts with the Imperium at\nlarge, a fact that often gives them great influence and leverage\nover Imperial Commanders that rely on other planets to\nsustain themselves.\nThe Administratum has devised a characteristically complex\nsystem for cataloguing the functions of the Imperium’s worlds.\nWhile some relate to the world’s environment, most describe\nthe function the planet serves within the Imperium itself. The\nmore common types are described below.",

In order to defend against pirate attack,\nrebellion, alien invasion or any other threat, each world maintains\nsome form of planetary militia. The number and nature of such\na force varies enormously, dependent upon the type of world. A\ndensely packed Hive world, for example, is able to raise many\nmillions of troops, and due to its huge industrial base is likely to\nbe able to equip its forces well. A less populated world is able to\nraise far fewer troops, but may be able to make up for the lack of\nnumbers in specialised skills. The Jungle Fighters of the Death\nworld of Catachan are a case in point. Few warriors in the entire\ngalaxy are able to match them in their native environment, and\nthey are such tough and determined soldiers that their skills are\never in demand regardless of the nature of the warzone.\nIn addition to his duty of providing troops, the Imperial\nCommander must also render heavy equipment, in the form of\ntanks, troops transports, artillery, and the like. Due to the nature\nof the Standard Template Construct, these are likely to be of\na standardised type common to most worlds in the Imperium.\nSometimes a world may produce equipment of an unusual pattern,\nbut these rarely join the ranks of the Imperial Guard due to the\ndifficulties in maintaining them. The Imperial Commander is\nalso obliged to provide massive reserves of arms and ammunition\nto the regiments raised from his world, and to maintain such\nstocks against future emergencies in nearby warzones.\nPlanetary defence forces go by any number of names and\nare organised and equipped according to the vagaries of local\ncustom. Some appear more ceremonial than functional, wearing\ngaudy uniforms and ornate armour, yet are recruited from highly\naccomplished warrior classes. The warriors of other militias\nappear more like rag-tag bandits, but are nonetheless hard bitten\nveterans and the match for any Imperial Guard unit.\nWhen required to provide troops for the Imperial Guard,\nthe Officio Munitorum demands the very best of an Imperial\nCommander’s defence forces. Withholding his elite units has\nproven the downfall of many an Imperial Commander, for often\nhe is held accountable for the performance of those troops he\nhas provided. If required by ongoing wars to provide more\nregiments, it is quite possible for a world’s militia to be stripped\nof its manpower entirely, making mass conscription a necessity,\nregardless of the effects on the planet’s economy.\nUpon joining the ranks of the Imperial Guard, the troopers of\nthe defence forces may come into contact for the very first time\nwith a whole range of troops they have never seen before.

Should pirates threaten a particular space lane, even\nthe smallest of the Imperial Navy’s squadrons are generally\nsufficient to deter further piracy, and if the problem persists, the\nNavy will hunt the pirates down, locating their hidden bases\nand destroying them utterly. Should a more concerted enemy\nthreaten a region, the Imperial Navy are likely to be the first\nline of defence, and many an invasion has been halted in its\ntracks before even making planetfall by way of mighty battles\nfought in the outer regions of a threatened star system.\nAnother task performed by the Imperial Navy is that of\ntransporting the land forces of the other military arms across\nspace.

    "content": "The Deathwatch operates under conditions of great secrecy;\nits existence is not widely known nor are its victories widely\ncelebrated. The Chapter’s origins are even more shrouded in\nsecrecy, for they are born of a solemn pact made between the\nInquisition and the Adeptus Astartes.\nCenturies ago, a conclave of Inquisitor Lords—the\nApocryphon Conclave of Orphite IV—convened with the\nsole purpose of formulating an Imperium-wide strategy to\ncombat the many xenos threats that assailed Mankind. The\nmembers of this conclave were, in the main, drawn from the\nranks of the Ordo Xenos, all of whom shared the belief that\none day, there would come a time when Humanity would be\nconsumed by slavering xenos beasts, or enslaved to creatures\nof unutterably alien origins. They foresaw an age when every\nalien life form in the galaxy, and others from beyond it, might\nrise up and the Age of the Imperium would come to an end.\nThey had no inkling when such a terrible age might come,\nbut they knew with dreadful certainty that it surely would,\nand they determined that no effort should be spared to avert\nsuch an end.\nThe conclave sat for many years, and bitter debate raged\nback and forth between Inquisitor Lords of many different\npositions. Some believed that every trace of alien life should be\npurged from the galaxy, while a few advocated the formation\nof alliances with those races that could be tolerated. Some\nspoke of ancient, god-like beings that have slumbered since\nbefore the creation of Mankind awakening to enslave the\ngalaxy, while others foresaw that death would come at the\nhands of invasion from other galaxies entirely. While many\nInquisitor Lords declared the conclave itself an admission of\ndefeat for even countenancing that Mankind might not prevail\nagainst these threats, wiser counsel prevailed, and a strategy\nwas eventually formulated. The conclave would request an\naudience with the assembled Chapter Masters of the Adeptus\nAstartes, and ask of them a solemn undertaking.\nHow many Chapter Masters assembled to hear the\nwords of the conclave is not known, for such an event has\nonly occurred a handful of times in the long history of the\nImperium. Nor were the words of the Inquisitors recorded\nfor posterity. Certainly, enough Chapter Masters must have\nanswered the call, for a quorum of sorts was convened. The\nconclave presented its prophecy to the Chapter Masters,\nevoking the galaxy-wide threat of the ravening xenos. The\nChapter Masters, every one a veteran of a thousand campaigns\nagainst the terrors of the void, listened to the Inquisitors’\nwords, and withdrew to consider the matter.\nThe results of the Chapter Masters’ deliberations were\ndelivered to the conclave at sunrise the next day. Each of the\nMasters and Inquisitors undertook a solemn oath together.\nThey would form a new Chapter, consisting of veteran Space\nMarines highly experienced in combating the xenos. This\nChapter was dubbed the ‘Deathwatch’, for it would stand\nguard against the doom foretold by the conclave. Thus, to\nthis day, this joint oath still stands. The Battle-Brothers of\nthe Deathwatch take the war against the alien to the very\ndarkest reaches of the void, bringing to bear such force\nas no individual Inquisitor could hope to muster. In this\nmission, the Ordo Xenos and the Deathwatch are equals,\nthe Inquisitors rooting out the foes for the Deathwatch to\neradicate. While neither party is subject to the command of\nthe other, both work in concert towards their common goal,\naccording to those oaths made centuries ago. The two work\nclosely together, ever watchful for that fateful day when the\nprophecies of the conclave are realised.",

It is not uncommon\nfor especially skilled Battle-Brothers to be called to serve many\ntimes, and at some point, such veteran alien-hunters are likely\nto be afforded the honour of assuming the rank of Watch\nCaptain. In accepting this role, the individual knows that he\nwill not return to his Chapter for many years, for the time for\nwhich he serves as Watch Captain is generally counted as a\nsingle ‘mission’ in itself.\nThe role of the Watch Captain is to oversee one or more Killtraining, equipping and deployment. It is also the Watch\nCaptain’s duty to record the Battle-Brothers’ deeds in battle,\nand to ensure that, if possible, the remains of the fallen are\nreturned to their parent Chapters with all due honour.\nIt is relatively unusual for a Watch Captain to accompany his\nwarriors on a mission, but he occasionally does so if especially\ndangerous foes are being faced and his personal intervention\nmight turn the battle. In many cases, the Watch Captain oversees\na mission from nearby, often in a Thunderhawk gunship\nespecially equipped to serve as a combination of command\ncentre, emergency surgery, arsenal and quarantine facility for\ncaptured foes. From his gunship, the Watch Captain is able to\nmonitor the progress of the mission, seeing exactly what each\nBattle-Brother sees by way of the multi-band sensors built into\ntheir power armour. He can also monitor the physiological\ncondition of his warriors, ensuring that no alien biological\ncontaminants are transmitted onwards on their return.\nWhen the Watch Captains do take to the battlefield, their\npresence can turn the tide of combat. A Watch Captain is both\na leader, with experience in commanding troops and inspiring\ndeeds of great heroism, and a fearsome warrior in his own right.\nHe has seen every horror the galaxy has to offer, and stood\nfirm against them all. He can remain unshaken even in the face\nof a gargantuan alien terror capable of wiping out an entire\narmy, and discern immediately its most vulnerable weakness.\nThe Watch Captains of the Deathwatch are amongst the most\nheroic of the Imperium’s servants, even if their names and their\ndeeds are never known to any but their Battle-Brothers.",

    "content": "A Watch Commander and all of the Kill-teams under his\ncommand are based in a Watch Fortress. Such places can take a\ngreat many forms; some are mighty deep space stations, while\nothers are imposing, fortified keeps on a planet’s surface. Some\nare impenetrable installations many miles below ground, while\nothers still are hollowed out asteroids bristling with weaponry\nand protected from prying eyes by arcane cloaking systems.\nWithin each Watch Fortress the Kill-teams train and prepare\nfor coming missions. Each fortress combines the functions of\ncommand centre, keep, archive, garrison and more. The Watch\nCommander often coordinates the monitoring of a hundred\ndifferent threats; or his attentions might be focused exclusively\non one single, overriding concern towards which all of his\nefforts are turned. The commander is assisted in his duties by a\ncadre of specialists, some of whom are Space Marines, such as\nTechmarines, Apothecaries and the likes, while many more are\nthe equivalent of Chapter Serfs. Some are specialists seconded\nfrom the staff of one or more Inquisitors, while the greatest\nnumber are mono-task Servitors.\nAmongst the most important members of the staff are the\nAstropaths, several of whom are always present in any Watch\nFortress. At all times, at least one Astropath is locked in an\narmoured saviour-chamber (sometimes referred to as the ‘ebon\ncoffin’) with its own life-support system, which is isolated from\nthat of the fortress. In the event of the facility being overrun,\nit is intended that this Astropath will survive long enough to\ntransmit a message to the nearest Inquisitorial bastion or Space\nMarine home world. Getting such a message out is far more\nimportant than the Astropath’s survival of course, and many\nhave committed suicide rather than fall into enemy hands, once\nreasonably certain their message has been received. That being\nsaid, one Astropath in the service of the Inquisition is known\nto have survived for six months within his saviour-chamber,\nwhile hideous Drugh slithered around the fortress and rasped\nineffectually at the chamber’s armoured hatch. By the time the\nfortress was retaken, the poor soul was quite insane, and put\nout of his misery soon after.\nThe number of Kill-teams stationed in any given Watch\nFortress varies enormously. Some are home to only a handful\nof Battle-Brothers, while others host several dozen Kill-teams.\nDespite the small number of warriors stationed on even the\nlargest Watch Fortress, it would be suicide for an enemy\nto attempt an attack on one, even if its location could be\ndetermined. Each bristles with weaponry, much of it controlled\nby hard-wired Servitors or fired remotely by the Watch\nCommander’s staff. Some are even said to be protected by\ngreat cannons and banks of missiles controlled by autonomous\nmachine spirits.\nAt the heart of each fortress is to be found a sealed vault,\ncontaining the most sensitive and valuable of assets. It is said\nthat some of these vaults are encased within stasis fields;\nthat time stands still within and even the most ancient and\ncrumbling parchments can be preserved. Other vaults are said\nto be encased within quantum-displacement fields, so that they\nare not actually located in the Watch Fortress at all, but exist out\nof phase with it so that even should the fortress be destroyed\nthe contents at its heart will survive. Exactly what is kept\nwithin these vaults depends upon the mission of the fortress\nand the threats it guards against. Some contain vast libraries\nof forbidden texts, knowledge so terrible they may only be\nconsulted when the very fate of Humanity itself hangs in the\nbalance. Alien artefacts of unknown or devastating potency\nmight also be sealed within the vault, affording the savants of\nthe Ordo Xenos the opportunity to study them whilst they are\nkept out of the hands of those who would use them for the\ndetriment of Mankind. Some Watch Fortresses even maintain\na stock of the most exotic of weapons, which are kept safe in\nthe vault and only brought forth in the most dire of situations.\nHere are found the warheads of the cyclonic torpedoes used to\nenact Exterminatus upon a world. Some weapons are unique\nand so potentially devastating they may never be disturbed, the\nsingular relics of the Dark Age of Technology. This includes\nsuch artefacts as the anti-baryon detonator held in a Watch\nFortress at the heart of the Ghoul Stars, and the super-massive\n‘starbane’ vortex cascade generator secreted within the eonAside from these sealed stocks of weaponry, each fortress\ncontains vast stores of more conventional arms and ammunition.\nSufficient stores to last for centuries without re-supply are held\nin the Watch Fortresses, as well as all of the heavy equipment\nnormally utilised by the Space Marines such as artillery and\nvehicles. Many of the weapons are venerated relics, crafted by\nlong-dead master-artisans whose names have become legendary\namongst the Space Marines.\nThe larger of the Watch Fortresses are home to all manner\nof training facilities. In vast domes, unique environments can be\nrecreated in which the Battle-Brothers can perfect their battle\ndrill and rehearse their missions. Some of these domes have\nbeen stocked with life forms, such as Death world flora and\nfauna, in order to create the most realistic training conditions\npossible. It has even been known for captured aliens to be set\nloose in the training domes, to be hunted down by the KillAlthough no resource is spared the Kill-teams, it is usual\nthat each Battle-Brother lives an austere existence in the Watch\nFortress. It is common for each to maintain a personal shrine,\nat which he undertakes the devotions and rites particular to his\nown Chapter. A Battle-Brother seconded from the Ultramarines\nChapter, for example, might maintain a simple chapel dedicated\nto the Primarch Roboute Guilliman, while one drawn from the\nMortifactors Chapter might keep vigil before the flensed skulls\nof a hundred slain enemies. When not engaged upon a mission\nor a training exercise, and not meditating at his own chapel, the\nSpace Marine may rest in a cell which is seldom more than a\nbare, stone-walled chamber. Space Marines require little sleep\nhowever, and most of the their time is spent either in battle, or\npreparing for it.",

They may have\nbeen placed centuries ago, perhaps on the word of a mystic’s\nprophecy or an especially auspicious reading of the Emperor’s\nTarot, or it may be that a great enemy was defeated at that\nlocation and its possible return is being guarded against.\nAs with the Watch Fortresses, Watch Stations can take\nmany forms. A great many are silent sentinels in orbit around\na world, while others are lonely towers standing guard over a\nlong dead battlefield. Watch Stations provide facilities for little\nmore than a single Kill-team and the Battle-Brothers are rarely\nstationed on one for any great length of time; the resources\nof the Deathwatch too scarce for every such station to be\npermanently staffed. Instead, Watch Stations may be used as\na staging point should a threat become apparent, and to this\nend they are always stocked with vast reserves of ammunition,\narms and equipment.\nWhile they are not always manned by Battle-Brothers, many\nWatch Stations are home to a skeleton crew of sensor-techs\nand watch-serfs.

Space\nMarines, above all others, are created to defend the Imperium\nfrom against the most severe of threats, and recognise the\ndangers aliens pose to Humanity. There are some intelligent\nraces that are so utterly different in form and nature that just\nto consider them is challenging, and to look upon them is\nmind shattering.

It is a testament to the\nChapter’s status that it has access to the very highest echelons\nof the Cult Mechanicus, and to technological marvels beyond\neven the reach of the Space Marines. Perhaps the most obvious\nexpression of this access is to be seen in the many types of\nhighly specialised ammunition the Chapter uses. Through\ncountless engagements, the Chapter has developed specialised\npoisons keyed to the biology of specific aliens, and these can be\ndelivered by way of specialised bolt rounds. The Deathwatch\nmakes use of tracking devices that utilise otherwise lost\nbranches of technology, including electro-magnetic scanners,\nmotion detectors and co-efficient prognostication units. Each\nBattle-Brother commonly bears equipment only carried by\nspecialists in his own Chapter, ranging from melta-bombs to\nthe highly prized vortex grenade.",

While a regular, ‘Codex’ Chapter is organised so as\nto be highly mobile and flexible, and to be deployed almost anywhere in the galaxy on short notice, the\nDeathwatch often focuses on one threat, in one region. This means that a Watch Commander is able to\ntailor his forces to the task at hand. Some Watch Fortresses stand guard over vast Ork empires, ever ready\nto oppose the nigh-unstoppable invasions they periodically unleash. Others guard against more shadowy\nthreats, far harder to detect yet every bit as dangerous. Still more face a myriad of foes and must constantly\nadapt to an ever-changing strategic situation.\nThe Deathwatch has access to all of the specialised war machines used by other Chapters, and more. Even\nif a Watch Fortress makes no regular use of such equipment, it keeps mothballed stocks of everything from\nattack bikes to strike cruisers, for use as and when required.\nIn structure, the Deathwatch does not adhere to the strict organisation of squads and companies that the Codex\nAstartes dictates. The only relevant tactical unit is the Kill-team, which may be organised and equipped in any\nway the Watch Captains deem appropriate. In one mission the team may go to war on Space Marine bikes, and in\nthe next mounted on a mighty Land Raider. Those Battle-Brothers with the requisite knowledge might go to war\nclad in hulking Terminator armour, or in lightweight Scout armour with chameleonic cloaks. Occasionally, several\nKill-teams are combined into a larger force, a sure sign that a highly dangerous foe is to be faced.\nIt is perhaps inevitable that Space Marines new to a term of service in the Deathwatch might experience\na period in which they must adjust to this foreign mode of organisation. This is especially the case when it\ncomes to Chapters that adhere rigidly to the Codex Astartes, such as the Ultramarines and their Successors.\nIn practice, a Battle-Brother who could not adjust would not be sent to the Deathwatch, and those that\ndo are often the most highly effective of warriors.",

    "content": "“We must scour them from the stars before they do the same to us.”\n–Chaplain Cassius of the Ultramarines\nThe Tyranids are the most alien of the races to curse the galaxy\nwith their existence. An elemental force, they mass in voidstop. The Tyranids are believed to have migrated from beyond\nthe known galaxy in search of new systems to consume;\nravening swarms descending upon planets and stripping them\nof all life. Every living thing is consumed, brought back to\nthe hive ships and dissolved into a rich biological gruel from\nwhich new Tyranid organisms are grown. When the Tyranids\nmove on in search of fresh prey, they leave planets as nothing\nbut balls of scoured rock in their wake.\nUnlike many other alien threats facing Mankind, the\nTyranids are an entirely new enemy. The arrival of this galactic\nthreat first came to light when Inquisitor Kryptman of the\nOrdo Xenos recovered a data-slate from the barren husk\nthat had once been the Imperial world of Tyran. The alien\nfleets were composed of an innumerable tide of living craft,\nfrom biological attack vessels to gargantuan, tentacled hive\nships — all cells in a single alien organism that threatened to\ndevour the Imperium. Codified as ‘Behemoth’, the Tyranid\ninvasion devoured entire sectors, and culminated in one of\nthe largest space battles in the Imperium’s history, around\nthe rings of Circe. Both the Ultramarines and Battlefleet\nTempestus suffered terrible casualties before the invasion was\nfinally broken.\nDespite the great victory won at Circe, it was soon\ndiscovered that defeating the Tyranids was not such a simple\nmatter. Although the vast bulk of the Tyranids’ vessels were\ndestroyed, the smaller ones scattered, and soon small ‘splinter\nfleets’ were appearing across the Eastern Fringe. But a fraction\nof the size of Behemoth, even the smallest of the splinter fleets\nis capable of laying waste to an entire world, and the largest\nthat have been faced, in particular those currently active in\nthe Jericho Reach region, consist of vast swarms capable of\noverrunning entire star systems.\nDuring the bitter fighting against Behemoth, the\nDeathwatch undertook a number of vital missions, including\nnigh-suicidal boarding actions against the largest of vessels,\nwhich were theorised to have some sort of control function\nover the hive fleet. During these missions, much vital\nexperience was earned, and this was soon expanded as Space\nMarines of the Ultramarines Chapter, which had borne the\nbrunt of the fighting, took service in the Deathwatch.\nMany in the higher echelons of the Imperium’s command\nstructure believe the dire threat represented by Behemoth\nto have been averted. While efforts to defeat the remaining\nsplinter fleets are ongoing, the leaders give thanks that the hive\nfleet was destroyed, even if the cost was almost unbearably\nhigh. There are many in the Ordo Xenos who are not so\nsure however, and counsel vigilance against the return of the\nTyranids. Many are the Watch Stations of the Deathwatch\nthat have turned their unblinking eyes upon the darkness of\ninterstellar space, ever watchful for the stars being snuffed out\nby the innumerable vessels of another Tyranid hive fleet.",

Just one\nwitch, unsanctioned, caused the destruction of Hive Skorpios when\none of those things used her brain as a gateway to this world. Within\nthree days the entire hive’s population was reduced to drooling mindbecause the governor thought his family should be exempt from the\npsyker cull and refused to give his daughter to the Black Ships.”\n–Inquisitor Mallen, Ordo Xenos\nThe Enslavers represent a form of life entirely anathema to\nany other in the galaxy. Though biological, these beings\nappear to exist primarily in the warp, yet no details of their\nnature are known. What makes the race dangerous to the\nImperium, and indeed to all life in the galaxy, is the fact\nthat the Enslavers make incursions into the material universe\nwhich, if not checked, soon escalate into planet-wide plagues.\nIn such a case, Exterminatus is a merciful end to the planet’s\nenslaved population.\nWhat is known of the Enslavers is that, from the warp, they\nare able to detect the presence of powerful, yet unprotected\npsykers in the material realm, and use their minds to create\na portal between the two dimensions. This process is a gross\nblasphemy in itself, for the unfortunate victim’s body is\ntransformed into a distended, writhing archway, the pulsating\ndarkness of the abyss at its core. Through this gateway, the\nEnslavers pour in ever-greater numbers. Having established\nthemselves in the material universe, these vile creatures\nenslave any and all intelligent life forms within range, taking\ncomplete control of their bodies, and using them as an army\nof mind-slaved drones.\nTo be enslaved is said to be amongst the worst possible fates\nthat can befall a man. While his mind remains fully aware of\nhis plight, his body is no longer his to control. He is nothing\nbut a puppet of the Enslavers, to be used as they wish. The\naliens have no knowledge or concern for the physical well\nbeing of their drones, and use them until they fail, whether\nthrough starvation, neglect or wounding. The drones stumble\nforward under the crude control of their masters, forced\nagainst their will to bear arms against their own. As the\nEnslaver Plague, as these catastrophes are known, progresses,\never greater numbers of meat-puppets are enslaved, until vast,\nuncountable hordes of drones overwhelm the planet. What\nhappens once the Enslavers’ victory is achieved is unknown,\nand frankly too horrible to consider.\nAlthough not as prevalent a threat as other alien races,\nthe Enslavers are nonetheless guarded against with utmost\nvigilance. Punitive Deathwatch actions are launched at\nthe slightest suspicion of imminent plague, for the span of\ntime between the appearance of the first gateway and total,\noverwhelming infestation can be shockingly rapid. Predicting\nwhere such plagues might occur is nigh impossible, except\nperhaps with frequent and skilled recourse to the Emperor’s\nTarot. Ultimately, the only way to be sure that no plagues\ntake place is by way of stringent psyker culls and the eternal\nmission of the Black Ships.\nrise Of The ancienTs\n“There are shrivelled things laying in cold tombs far below the\nsurface of dead worlds that once bestrode the galaxy. And there are\nthose who by their deeds would awaken such creatures. Not on my\nwatch...”\n–Brother Fenrik Red-Eye of the Deathwatch\nThe galaxy is truly ancient, and evidence of extinct stellar\nempires abounds. Countless human cities have been built\nover the crumbling remains of far older civilisations, with\nno concern of what might slumber in dusty tombs far below\nthe ground. There exist entire hive cities hollowed into the\ninnards of miles-high alien structures. Even on the most long\nsettled and heavily populated worlds, out in the wilderness\nzones might stand wind-wracked obelisks built by unknown\nmasons. In many cases, the world’s original colonists would\nhave fought a war of extermination against whatever intelligent\nlife dwelled there first; on others, the aliens had died off or\ndeparted millennia before Mankind even set foot there.\nThere are those whose mission it is to ensure that the myriad\nlost empires of the galaxy stay that way. Inquisitors of the\nOrdo Xenos and their Deathwatch allies hunt down any trace\nof these extinct galactic empires, and seek out signs of their\ncontinued existence. This is because despite the fact that the\nlost empires are no longer a power, there are those who would\nsee them returned to their former status. These might be the\nfallen alien descendents of the once-mighty ancients, lurking\nin the wilderness and working unseen to renew their ancestors’\npower. In some cases, deluded humans work to resurrect lost\nalien civilisations, perhaps having acquired a fragment of lost\nand forbidden knowledge, or having fallen under the power\nof some artefact recovered from a sacred site.\nSome Inquisitors within the Ordo Xenos discern patterns\nof alien activity wherever they look. While those at the\nfrontlines may only perceive that which they face in the heat\nof battle, the oldest and wisest of Inquisitors and savants take\nnote of locations of tomb-worlds across entire sectors, regions,\nsegmentae and indeed, the galaxy. While many take their dire\nwarnings as the ravings of blasted old men, others see truth\nin their words, and fear what might become of Mankind were\nthese patterns to align, were the ancients themselves to awaken\naccording to some aeons-old configuration. The Jericho Reach\nis a region where such dark patterns have emerged, though\ntheir meaning defies human intelligence and sanity.\nSome amongst the Ordo Xenos believe that Mankind’s\ndoom will not come at the hand of any of the races extant\ntoday, but due to the deeds of the ancients themselves. They\nclaim that the Emperor’s Tarot is revealing ever more dire\nportents, warning of an age when the soulless minions of\nlong dead gods will rise from their tombs and harvest every\nlife form in the galaxy. They speak of alien savages lurking in\nthe jungles of distant fringe worlds casting off the mantle of\nignorance and reclaiming that which was once theirs. They\nspeak of the very gods themselves returning to do battle\nagainst one another; a war in which Mankind may be the\nfirst casualty.",

The missions undertaken\nby the Deathwatch are many and varied, and range from standing\nsentinel against a general threat to accompanying an alienknown space. Despite the variety of mission profiles in which\nthe Deathwatch excels, there are a number that form the basis of\nmost operations.\nOne of the simplest, yet arguably the most taxing, duties of\nthe Deathwatch is to stand eternal vigil against the actions of the\nxenos. This is the basis of the system of Watch Fortresses and\nWatch Stations. Each is located in an area where there exists a\nknown threat, or in a strategically significant region through which\nsuch a threat might approach Imperial worlds. An example of the\nformer would be a Watch Station placed on the outer reaches of\na system known to harbour the remains of an ancient xenos race,\nwith its mission being to guard against the enemy’s return. An\nexample of the latter would be a Watch Fortress positioned at the\nconfluence of known warp routes, along which alien invasions are\nknown or are likely to travel.\nInvestigation of potential threats is a vital task of the Deathwatch.\nIndividual Kill-teams are often called upon to perform sweeps of\nareas in which dangerous aliens are suspected of operating. Newly\ndiscovered worlds, visited by Explorators or Rogue Traders may\nbe judged as dangerous, and require a Deathwatch investigation,\nsometimes accompanied by an Inquisitor or other specialists. Such\nmissions can be perilous and the Kill-teams must be well prepared\nto face any threat. They are frequently undertaken far from any\npossibility of reinforcement or rescue should things go awry, so\nthe Battle-Brothers must look to each other for support, and\ncarry with them as much ammunition as possible. Investigation\nmissions can take the Kill-team to a staggering variety of worlds\nand environments, all of which its members must be prepared for.\nThe Battle-Brothers might be expected to cross a burning desert\nof jagged sulphur crystals, or acid swamps infested with alien\npredators.

An immense swathe of chill nothingness devoid of stars or\nworlds, its empty wastes are broken only by drifting invisible\ndust clouds of particulates that can shred hull armour as surely\nas a missile salvo and deadly null-energy reefs that can leave\na ship floundering and powerless before the merciless cold\nvoid.

Although the\nnominal tenure for these ships is ten months, it is rumoured\nin Imperial Navy circles that no single vessel during the last\ndecade has lasted more than seven months before having to\nsend for relief and quit its post thanks to hull degradation and\nmounting damage. In fact, an orbital dock above the Forge\nworld of Lathe-Het in the Calixis Sector is now set aside\npermanently to attend to this ongoing need for repair.\nSuffice to say, once passing through the Warp Gate, ships\nseldom tarry long in the Well of Night before travelling on\nunder normal warp drive to their selected destination.",

With such a heart, a warrior can stand\nagainst the terrors of the universe unbowed and unbroken.”\n–Attributed to Ferrus Manus\nWatch Fortress Erioch is a vast space bastion that lies in the\nouter reaches of the Erioch system in the untamed void between\nthe Canis and Acheros salients. It is situated in a stellar dead\nzone populated by only a handful of failing, ancient stars—of\nwhich Erioch itself is one. A brutal mass of armoured basilica,\ndomes, and spires, the Fortress bristles with enough armament\nto rival a sizable battlegroup of warships, largely concealing the\nfact that underneath the Imperial ceramite and firepower, it is\nbuilt on a ruined artefact that was old when Terra’s star was\nfirst forming. Within it is a vast maze of echoing, dust-carpeted\ncorridors that wander past silent chapels and armoured vaults\nsealed with adamantine doors. Beneath war-tattered banners of\nglories past, the Battle-Brothers of the Deathwatch in residence\nmove between cells, practice ranges, armouries and briefing\ntheatres like spectres in a dead city, their numbers swallowed by\nthe vast and labyrinthine nature of the fortress.\nWithin the Watch Fortress, the Deathwatch gathers to rearm,\ntrain, and report. From here, Kill-teams are dispatched on\nmissions to every corner of the Jericho Reach, and sometimes\nbeyond. The Fortress contains vast command cathedrals where\nWatch Captains come to discuss strategy, developments within\ntheir assigned vigils, and consult with the Inquisitor of the\nChamber and Master of Vigilance. Alongside the towering\nAdeptus Astartes scurry the far more numerous servitors and\nhooded, mind-wiped serfs that keep the Fortress alive and\nfunctioning. These lobotomised or oath-bonded servants crew\nthe Watch Fortress’s weaponry, and serve under the eyes of the\nForge Master in the maintenance of its machine spirits, their\npasts shorn from them by mental conditioning. They remember\nnothing of their history, and know no life beyond the fortress\nand the demands of their duty.\nhe Watch Fortress could hold an entire Chapter of Adeptus\nAstartes with ease, but its records show that there are rarely\nmore than a few score Deathwatch garrisoning it at any time.\nEven during the grim events of the Council of the Ascension",

    "content": "The Adeptus Astartes aboard Watch Fortress Erioch are\nhoused in sparse single cells. By the traditions of the Watch\nFortress, each is bare and unadorned. The walls in each cell are\nformed of unrendered stone or unpolished metal, containing\nno more than a stone plinth to lie on, and housings for the\nstorage of a Battle-Brother’s personal weaponry, devotional\nitems, and other equipment. These simple quarters are the\nsame regardless of whether the Space Marine is a standard\nBattle-Brother or an honoured Watch Captain (however, some\nparticularly individual Space Marines flout this tradition by\ndisplaying trophies, keepsakes, or other reminders of their\nhome Chapter). By the same traditions, Battle-Brothers\narriving at the Watch Fortress are grouped together in cells\nnext to Battle-Brothers already in residence with no division\nby rank or fighting formation. Likewise, the taking of food and\ndrink is traditionally done together in one of the refectories,\nwith the Battle-Brothers sitting on stone benches beside iron\ntopped tables beneath the light of devotional candles.\nhough the Watch Fortress is the domain of the Adeptus\nAstartes of the Deathwatch, other men and women live and\nserve within it. Serfs and other important functionaries, such\nas the fortress’s Astropathic choir, are housed in enclaves\nwell-removed from the Battle-Brothers of the Deathwatch\nand sealed away from ready access to the deep places of the\nfortress and its many vaults. The Inquisitor of the Chamber of\nVigilance traditionally keeps residence in the Tower of Brass,\nwhich juts into the vacuum from the upper hull of the fortress\nlike a blade tip projecting from the back of a skewered foe.\nThis tower, while part of the fortress, is left alone by the\nDeathwatch out of courtesy, unless duty or suspicion call\nthem there. Within this vast edifice, the Inquisitor of the\nChamber houses his personal staff and entourage. It is, in\neffect, his personal domain to maintain as he wishes. Other\nInquisitors who come to the Watch Fortress are often made\npersonal guests by the Inquisitor of the Chamber and housed\nwithin the Tower of Brass. Some, however, are either not\ngiven the honour of such an invitation, or prefer to keep their\nown company, and are housed in one of the fortresses many\nsets of state rooms which lay empty until needed.\nreliQuaries of The Tools of war\nThe armouries of the Fortress are located deep beneath its\narmoured hull, secured behind the thickest blast doors and\ninternal layers of void shielding of the kind more commonly\nused to protect Battle Titans. This is the realm of metal and\nactinic light, of the beat of hammers and the fire of forges\nthat arm and armour the Emperor’s angels of death. Made\nup of workshops, magazines and armouries, these are the\ndomains of the Techmarines that serve in the Deathwatch,\nand all fall under the ultimate authority of the Forge Master\nof the Watch Fortress. Chainswords, power axes, bolters, drop\npods, tanks, thunderfire cannons, and all of the tools of the\nAdeptus Astartes are held here; their war-like machine spirits\nsoothed by the machine buzz of servitors and the touch\nof sacred oils until they are needed. There also are billions\nof rounds, charges, and cylinders of ammunition from the\nsimplest laspack to the massive grav-stabilised macro-shells\nfired by the fortress’s main batteries.\nIn the deepest reaches of the armouries, curled in waiting\nsleep, are the ancients of the Deathwatch. Those who have\nbeen grievously injured in serving with the Deathwatch may,\nwith the blessing of his Chapter, be granted the honour\nof being installed in the cyborganic web of an armoured\nsarcophagus so that in times of great need, they may once\nagain serve alongside their Battle-Brothers as a Dreadnought.\nThere are believed to be three such rare and mighty ancient\nDreadnoughts currently dormant within the armouries of\nWatch Fortress Erioch, though they have not been awakened\nto war in over a century. Only the Forge Master knows the\ntruth of their number and state.\nMany of the most exotic and potent weapons of the\nfortress, however, are held within sealed vaults deep within\nthe Watch Fortress, accessible only to those who bear the\nsecret of their opening. Some vaults only open to members\nof a particular Chapter or those who bear the gene-seed of a\nparticular Primarch, being gifted or left in trust by one of that\nChapter’s number. Others only open to particular members\nof the Inquisition or Adeptus Mechanicus. Most secret of\nall are the terrible devices kept in the outer catacombs of\nthe Omega Vault, the great sealed chamber at the heart of\nWatch Fortress Erioch. Such weapons include vortex torrent\nimploder charges, dread canisters of the life-eater virus, and\nthe imprisoned nightmare childe.

And in that moment of heresy they doom\nthemselves most surely”\n–From the sermons of Sebastian Thor\nCastobel is a battered Hive world, ruled by a noble-born elite,\nthat remained loyal to the Imperium’s ways through the Jericho\nReach’s long Age of Shadow. It is also a world that is now all\nbut alone, facing any enemy that wants nothing more than to\nconsume it utterly. While other worlds fell to anarchy and the\nlure of false gods, Castobel remained true to the Imperial Creed\nand faithful to the belief that, in time, the Imperium would\nreturn to restore it to its glory. Through the application of\nbrutal authority, a council of nobles called the Aquilan Pluracy\nkept the population in order, the cathedrals un-profaned, and\nthe forges and manufactorums fed by resources harvested from\nthe lesser planets in its system. The Pluracy helped Castobel’s\nhard-pressed defences weather the storms of intermittent\nraiders and xenos predators from beyond. When the Crusade\nforces reached Castobel, they were welcomed. The Crusade\nfound a world willing and able to give support and eager\nto rejoin the Imperium. Since then, Castobel has revelled in\nits importance to the prosecution of the Crusade; its rulers\napply greater and greater brutality to its somewhat threadbare\npopulation in order to yield up weaponry, provisions, and\nregiments of troops to aid the Crusade.\nHive Fleet Dagon arrived without warning, and Castobel\nwas once again severed from all contact with the Imperium.\nThanks to their brutal iron-fisted control, the Pluracy averted\nmass panic turning into riot, but soon, stories began to circulate\nof unholy things stalking the lightless depths of the hives and\nrumours spread of the dark fates that befell the Crusade in the\ncold void beyond. Work and production levels have fallen,\nand the reports of seditious whispers from the Pluracy’s vast\nnetwork of informers have risen almost exponentially across\nthe entire system. Desperate attempts have been made to reand beleaguered Crusade ships managed to make it to port\nto re-arm and re-fit. The crews of these ships spread tales of\nmonsters stalking the stars and terrible battles lost. Afterwards,\na great dark mass appeared in the night sky above Castobel,\nblotting out the light of the stars. Troops were mustered and\ndesperate and largely unheard pleas to the Crusade forces were\nscreamed by the planet’s remaining Astropaths. On the eve\nof 817.M41, dark spores began to fall on Castobel, despite\nthe many more gunned into oblivion by the world’s ancient\ndefence networks. Deserted and doomed, many of the planet’s\nruling elite became lost to despair and flung themselves from\nthe highest spires of Hive Cressos, while others determined to\nsell the world dearly to the inhuman enemy. Castobel is now\na world at war against the most terrible enemy imaginable,\nits hive cities besieged and its hardy population fighting for\ntheir very survival. Its fate, however, is yet to be sealed, as the\nTyranid forces that have descended upon it were but a part of\nthe greater whole, and were not so numerous as to overwhelm\nCastobel quickly or completely. The world’s barren surface\nof lifeless wind-scoured deserts and volcanic plains have also\nproved an advantage in resistance, as they take their toll on the\ninvader and offer little biomass to fuel the enemy’s onslaught.\nWhile two of Castobel’s six major hive complexes have fallen,\none turned itself into an atomic funeral pyre while dying,\nwhich robbed the enemy of its flesh. The others are holding\nout, however precariously, for the moment. The Deathwatch\nhas also become aware of Castobel’s plight, and is now\nconsidering its own plans for possible intervention.\nhe fate of Castobel remains in the balance, although\none thing is certain—its future is even now being written\nin blood.",

Hethgard was a once mining world whose mountains\nand chains of dormant volcanoes were long ago stripped of\nthe great wealth of rare metallic ores they contained. What\nremained afterwards were plains of shattered stone that\nglimmered with a metallic sheen, broken mountains riddled\nwith echoing passages, and numberless unmapped shafts.\nAlthough sucked dry of resources, the fortress engineers of\nthe Achilus Crusade found Hethgard was perfectly suited for\nLord Militant Achilus’s strategic needs. Many of Hethgard’s\nmountainsides were sheathed in armoured skins, and generators,\nstorehouses and barracks were sunk deep into the abandoned\nmine-workings. The defences were ringed with thousands\nof miles of walls, razorwire, and mines, while chambers\ndeep within the mountain fortresses were converted to vast\nmagazines to feed the thousands of weapon emplacements that\ncrowned the armoured mountain summits. Thus, Hethgard was\nconverted into a mighty fortress to protect the Crusade’s flank\nand an armoury for its forces second only to Karlack itself. In\nthe three decades it has stood, no enemy has taken Hethgard.\nHowever, its defences have been seriously tested twice: once\nby the marauding Ork freebooters of the Brass Eye, and once\nby an unknown, powerful, non-humanoid xenos-form who\nattacked in black orb-like war machines. These raiders were\ndriven off thanks, in part, to the timely intervention of the\nDeathwatch.",

    "content": "“If Humanity will not unite, it will be destroyed. If the price of\nunity is a billion lives, or ten billion, or a number as like to the\ngrains of sand on the shore, then we must pay it. If we do not,\nif we are not united, then we stand weak and divided against the\nremorseless enemies of an apocalyptic age.”\n–Cardinal Salazar Scrone, Sermon on Mount Amalath\nVanir is a system of inhabited worlds that is the site of a\nfrantic battle between the forces of the Achilus Crusade and\nrebels loyal to the self-proclaimed Monarchs of the Kingdom\nof Vanir. The desperate forces of Battlegroup Icarus, having\nwithdrawn after taking massive casualties from the advancing\nTyranids, are now locked in a race to overcome the rebel\nforces that have taken possession of the Vanir system. The\nImperials know that time is short and that the only chance\nof surviving the oncoming tide of Tyranids is to renew the\nsystem’s defences before the Tyranids come to destroy Vanir\nand lay waste to loyalist and rebel alike.\nDuring the Age of Shadow, Vanir was the seat of the false\n‘Kingdom of Vanir,’ a petty empire held together by the\nmilitary power of the Monarchs. A small fleet of warp-capable\nships kept the closely-situated worlds of the Kingdom together\nthrough fear of orbital bombardment and the deployment of\nthe Monarchs’ dreaded gene-enhanced Crown Guard. When\nthe Crusade forces reached the worlds of the Kingdom, a yearattack on Vanir itself by Space Marines of the Storm Wardens\nChapter and the bloody defeat of the Crown Guard. Many of\nthe Monarchs fled before the wrath of the Imperium as Vanir\nwas forced brutally into compliance; some were hunted down\nand executed by being crowned with molten gold, but a few\nescaped into hiding. Later, communications were broken by\nthe shadow in the warp cast before Hive Fleet Dagon. This\nthrew the Imperials into disarray and the surviving monarchs,\nlong plotting the violent overthrow of Imperial rule again,\nseized the opportunity to spark off a revolt. This rebellion\nlifted the yoke of Imperial rule once more, bringing down the\noverlord government in a bloodbath of civil war, and gaining\ncontrol of Vanir.\nRagged elements of Battlegroup Icarus attempted to regroup\nat Vanir after fighting the invading Tyranids along the Salient.\nHowever, they were attacked as they entered the system and\nfound themselves fighting a war against the resurgent forces\nof the Monarchs. In desperate need of the resources of the\nVanir system, the Battlegroup had no choice but to fight at a\ncrippling disadvantage—their fleet-based firepower muzzled\nby the fact that they could not risk destroying the infrastructure\nor defences that they would need when the Tyranids arrived.\nWith the sands of time running short, Vanir remains a\nworld divided and facing annihilation.\nThe faTe of BaTTleGroup arGo\nBattlegroup Argo was the Crusade Command Battlegroup of the Orpheus Salient from which General Curas directed the\nrapid advance of the Crusade forces under his command. The General always wished to oversee the leading edge of his\nadvance in person, and so Battlegroup Argo was almost invariably at the forefront of the Crusade advance, carrying with\nit the personal regiments of his chosen command. In its most famous action, the Battlegroup had the honour of cleansing\nEleusis of the Charnel Oracles and seeing the long-desecrated shrines torn down and rebuilt in the worship of the GodVanir. As was typical of Curas, when the then unknown threat of Hive Fleet Dagon darkened communications within\nthe salient, he ordered Battlegroup Argo to plunge into the heart of the shadow. Details of what occurred next have been\nfound only in the nightmarish memories of a handful of broken men who escaped from Argo’s death throes. Its last known\nposition was on the edge of the Phonos system when a massive attack of monstrous creatures descended on it from the cold\nvoid. What few survivors escaped did so on trailing escort vessels that fled as writhing darkness fell on the fleet. All were\nlater executed by the Imperial Navy for cowardice.\nNo word has ever been heard from Battlegroup Argo since that day. Many believe the Battlegroup is irrevocably lost,\nand General Curas with it. Others, however, suspect that the fate of Battlegroup Argo may have been far worse than mere\ndestruction at the hands of a ravenous enemy. Wrecked and scarred hulls of former Imperial Warships filled with harbinger\norganisms have been observed arriving in advance of the main Hive Fleet, scattered like deadly seeds upon the wind. These\nships are of familiar line and measure and some are still broadcasting Crusade-encrypted distress calls like the automated\nscreams of the unquiet dead.",

In the lost days\nof the old Jericho Sector, Karlack was little more than an outlying,\nlargely unremarkable, colony world. Its population never rose\nhigh enough to make it a power in sector politics, nor did it\npossess resources of sufficient calibre to make it of particular\ninterest to the Adeptus Terra. When the Age of Shadow came,\nKarlack’s relatively marginalised status protected it somewhat\nand cushioned its slide into isolation, sparing it much of the war\nand disaster that stalked worlds closer to the sector’s core. Over\nthe centuries, it descended slowly into pre-industrial feudalism.\nAfter the discovery of the Jericho-Maw Warp Gate, Karlack’s\nfate was decided by a simple expediency of stellar geography:\nit was the closest life-sustaining system of any strategic worth\nin the Jericho Reach in proximity to the Warp Gate. Thus, it\nwas the first system on which Lord Militant Achilus set his eye.\nThe mass forces of the Crusade were welcomed with open arms\nby Karlack’s natives whose local culture had long kept alive\nthe hand-me-down traditions of the Imperial Creed and the\nMastery of the Emperor. The Crusade’s Ministorum contingent\nquickly set about bolstering that faith and rooting out heresy and\ncorruption in the population. Swiftly, mountains were levelled to\nprovide raw materials, rolling steppe land planed into mustering\ngrounds for tens of thousands of troops, and vast fortifications\nraised both on the ground and in orbit. Not to be outdone,\nthe Adeptus Mechanicus hollowed out orbiting asteroids into\ngun-stations and crafted orbital docks to serve as the Crusade’s\nprimary anchorage.\nSince this time, Karlack has remained the primary seat of the\nCrusade’s power and the principal rallying point and supply hub\nfor the Imperial forces in the Jericho Reach. Its orbital stations\nhouse key command and control elements for the Crusade fleets,\na Naval repair and provender base, and the Crusade’s primary\nAstropathic Choir. Karlack is also the keystone in a wide arc of\nlistening posts and defence stations known as the Iron Collar,\nspread out across the portion of the Jericho reach bordering the\nWell of Night, from which the Crusade salients are supported.",

Renowned for many\nyears as a corsair stronghold, this former Imperial planet and its\noppressed population have long been enslaved to one warlord\nor another, with Khazant’s naval dockyards and plentiful\nresources its principal prize. From the Achilus Crusade’s outset,\nKhazant was always considered a primary target, and its initial\nconquest, and the driving of heretic forces from the Khazant\nsystem in a year long campaign, was the last great victory of the\nCrusade under Lord Militant Achilus’s leadership. The former\noverlords of Khazant were allowed to escape; a development\nthat, in hindsight, would later have the darkest consequences\nfor the Crusade effort. Shortly afterwards, the newly-acclaimed\nLord Militant Tetrarchus divided the Crusade to form the three\nsalients. Raids by heretic forces into Imperial-held territories\nin the Cellebos region began to increase dramatically, and\nthe Acheros Salient, under Tetrarchus’s direct command,\nfound its main assault meeting massive, organised resistance\nhead-on. During this period, Khazant was temporarily cut off\nand overwhelmed, its garrisoning forces suffering near total\ncasualties before an Imperial counter-attack could once again\ncontest the system.\nSince then, control of Khazant has swung back and forth\nnumerous times, and its now wrecked surface has become the\nprincipal battleground of the war in the salient. Its star system\nis now littered with the wrecks of craft destroyed in action,\nand it has become the hunting ground of raiders from both\nsides. These raids are punctuated by attempts from heretic and\nImperial alike to run the gauntlet of enemy blockades to land\nreinforcements on the surface. On Khazant itself, Crusade\nregiments are still doing battle daily against the forces of the\nStigmatus and their unholy allies on a dozen fronts across a nobunkers, trench works and reeking mud. It is a war of endless\nartillery barrages, poison gas, grinding armour, and brutal\nhand-to-hand fighting that shows no sign of relenting.",

The system supported four verdant and paradisethe sector core. The Age of Shadows heralded a slow descent\ninto blasphemy for this system as, over time, the severed and\nabandoned human populations embraced barbarity and the\nfalse promises of the Dark Gods to save them from the brutal\npredations of off-world slavers and the obscene hungers of the\nalien. In 920.M37, Mataras IV was subject to the final sanction of\nExterminatus. This sanction was carried out by the Deathwatch\nin order to prevent a parasite-colony of the horrific Hadrus\nSkin-Weaver xenoform from spreading to neighbouring worlds.\nAs the populations of the Mataras Sisters slowly succumbed to\nthe worship of Chaos, they strove to excel over each other in\nsavagery and slaughter.

Although unclassified, it is\nsimilar to a Class III Warp disturbance, an overlapping vortex of\nturbulence in the Æther that spills over into Realspace, distorting\nand twisting its fabric and making navigation and observation\nalmost impossible within its baleful influence. While considerably\nsmaller than the great and legendary reality-lesions such as the\ndreaded Eye of Terror or the Maelstrom, it is no less dangerous. The\nCharon Stars, in turn, is the name of those stellar bodies trapped\nwithin the warp-breach’s grasp, stars that now cast a murderous\nand unclean radiance wherever their light falls. Resembling a “red\nhole” in space, the Hadex Anomaly rarely stays in the same place\nfor long, having been reported in different regions of space on\nnumerous occasions. The Anomaly’s mobility suggests that it may\nhave some malign sentience. One theory amongst the Adeptus\nMechanicus forces in the Achilus Crusade is that the Anomaly\nspews time from other dimensions into our own, distorting all\nattempts to monitor it more closely. The outer rim of the Anomaly\ncontains a debris-strewn ring of ghost ships, starfaring vessels that\nhave become trapped in some kind of stasis from which there is\nno release.\nhe Hadex Anomaly came into being during an-ill portended\nplanetary alignment in 656.M40. The Deathwatch’s records state\nthat the vortex was the result of some great and bloody design of\nthe mortal worshipers of Chaos come to fruition on one of the\nlost worlds it now has swallowed: a ritual unleashing the abyss of\nthe Warp into reality. Thanks to the sector’s fall into anarchy, no\nAgents of the Throne were there to stop it.\nIn the fury of its birth, the Anomaly briefly swelled to more\nthan twice its current diameter before swiftly receding again. The\nAnomaly has since grown steadily by fractions, year-by-year, until\nit reached its present size. Drowned in its hellish radiance were a\ndozen inhabited worlds that once made up the core of the Jericho\nSector of old. This includes its once-vaunted capitol, the hive\nworld of Varrus, long since fallen into bloody civil war and the\nworship of the Ruinous Powers. Some say that Varrus has since\nbeen transformed into a daemon world, where the servants of the\nChaos Gods plan the destruction of the Reach.\nWhatever dark powers are in control of the heretics that\ncontest the Cellebos warzone, it is those same powers that called\non the might of the Traitor Legions to their battle standards. The\nCharon Stars are their domain, and it is under these stars’ blood\nred light that their corrupt priests and commanders make their\nsacrificial offerings. Many rumours claim that these minions of\nthe Ruinous Powers seek to appease the Anomaly itself, as if it\nwere some ancient and powerful beast that had carried them here\nupon strange tides of the warp.",

Nevertheless, the\nexpeditionary force sent to scout the world was immediately\nopposed by Tau Hunter cadres attacking in force.\nEbongrave is convinced that something lies on Veren the\nTau want to defend, and that sending so many Tau to defend\nit indicates its importance. Ebongrave has ordered for Veren\nto be captured and held, but the Tau seem to know the planet\nvery well and use the air-filled coral tunnels beneath the\nshallow seas to move around Veren with impunity. The battles\nthrough Veren’s tunnels and in its mountain passes are vicious\nand at close-quarters, and the Tau suffer greater losses here\nthan anywhere else in the Canis Salient. Some in Ebongrave’s\ncommand believe that Veren is a huge feint, intended to draw\nImperial Guard regiments away from worlds that are truly\nimportant, and that the Tau will either leave and force the\nImperial Guard to tie up men garrisoning the world, or draw\nin more and more Guard until they can wipe them out in\nsome huge Tau-engineered cataclysm.

    "content": "a few extra notes for the GM\nThe Tantalus Extraction is an adventure based on an ongoing situation into which the player characters are thrust. It is important\nto remember that the characters that the Kill-team may find awaiting them at Pyroclast-Gamma-9 have their own motivations\nand fears, and have no idea that the Deathwatch has become involved in the situation (the exception is Magos they have come to\nrescue). This means that the NPCs may react in any number of ways, from sudden hope, to awe and outright terror. Remember\nthat Space Marines, while Mankind’s saviours on countless occasions, are often feared by normal men and women throughout\nthe Imperium. They are known as ‘The Angels of Death’ for a reason. Once inside Pyroclast-Gamma-9’s environs, the player\ncharacters have a free hand about how to proceed and what leads and plans to follow. It is up to you, as the GM, to respond to\ntheir actions, as you feel appropriate. When GMing an adventure like this one, where there is no set ‘right’ path for the player\ncharacters to follow, you should always feel free to embellish the details, come up with new encounters, and have events and\nindividuals react to the player characters’ actions. This will always make for a tighter story, give a sense of empowerment to your\nplayers and, accordingly, ensure a better game all round. Adventures like this one, even though they can be very combat oriented\nand have a relatively simple goal, demand a little more from the GM than a simple ‘dungeon bash’ style combat mission, simply\nbecause they are so freeform. As the GM, you will be required to think on your feet, keep an idea of what’s going on in your\nhead and respond to whatever plans and ideas your player’s might come up.\nThe key things are to be firm but fair; don’t be afraid to have NPCs act or react adversely and violently if the player characters’\nactions make this the logical outcome. Of course, reward quick thinking and good ideas on the players’ part with additional\ninformation, aid, and assistance as warranted.\nIt is important to be familiar with the details of the adventure itself, not simply so you know who is where and doing what,\nbut also so you can gauge how the significant NPCs will react to the unexpected. Thus you can add to things as you go along\nwithout risk of messing up the plot. Although it may sound obvious, a handy notebook to record names and the like as you go\nalong, not to mention details such as the countdown tally, is essential. This is all a bit of work, as you may have guessed, but\ncan also be hugely rewarding in its own right. If you’ve volunteered to be the GM, you’re probably something of a storyteller\nat heart, and will enjoy because the experience—you are master of your own epic story, packed with as much action and dark\nadventure as you wish.",

However, with the coming of the Achilus crusade and the resurgence of the hive world of Castobel,\nextensive promethium refinery infrastructure, the starport/city of Tantalus Landing and other settlements have been\nconstructed and the population has trebled through forced immigration of tithed workers and crusade forces.\nGovernmental Type: Crusade Dictatorship/Departmento Munitorum Satrapy.\nLunar Governor: Quastor-Intendant Charlotta Grimes.\nAdept Presence: Extensive Departmento Munitorum officio presence, sub-directorate level, minor presence Adeptus\nMechanicus/Chthonic, Adeptus Mechanicus/Biologis.

Death has come.\nIt is then, like deliverance sent from the Emperor himself, that\nthe Thunderhawk breaks the boiling purple-black clouds above\nyou, its dark hull pitted and scored with acid pockmarks, but\nits engines roaring white-hot in defiance of the storm. The pilot\ndares not land, but with consummate skill drops the main hatch\nat the hover, and you and your companions leap aboard to safety.\nYou glance back as the hatch draws shut to see a limitless tide of\nhorror begin to roll across the tortured earth below, and at last\ndoomed Tantalus dies beneath you.\nHowever, you have escaped the jaws of death, and will\ncontinue your watch another day.”",
