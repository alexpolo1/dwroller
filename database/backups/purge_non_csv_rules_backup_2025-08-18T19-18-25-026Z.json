This attitude is instilled in the Ultramarines from a very young age, long before consideration is given to recruitment into the Chapter. The people of Macragge in particular, and of Ultramar as a whole, are raised in a culture of discipline and service. On Macragge, it is common for a young man to leave his family whilst still a child to learn the ways of the warrior in one of the many martial communities of the world. In these schools, the youngster learns of honour and duty, practising and studying so that his arm is strong and his mind keen. It is from these communities that many of the Ultramarine aspirants are drawn, for they are well versed in the arts of war and ideal candidates for recruitment into the Chapter.",

The Codex Astartes is a work of divine wisdom, sanctified by the Emperor himself, and the Ultramarines see no reason to deviate from it. The life in the people of Ultramar from birth give them the strength of character to hold true to teachings over ten thousand years old. For any given tactical situation, the Codex offers hundreds of pages devoted to how it may be met and overcome.

The wisdom of thousands of the Imperium’s warriors has contributed to the Codex, and details on everything from unit markings to launching a fullThis is not to say that the Ultramarines are hidebound or unimaginative in their thinking, for it must not be forgotten that Primarch Roboute Guilliman is regarded as one of the most imaginative and innovative military thinkers of all time. It is rather a deep-seated belief that every problem can be solved with recourse to the Codex Astartes, that there is no need to reinvent solutions to dilemmas solved long ago. By their strict adherence to the Codex, the Ultramarines are in fact freed by it. The success of this doctrine is self-evident in the countless thousands of battle honours the Chapter has earned over ten millennia of loyal service to the Imperium.",

This is evidenced in the fact that a high proportion of Deathwatch leaders are drawn from the Ultramarines and their successors, a fact that has more to do with their outlook and character than it does with their numerical superiority.

By focusing his prodigious psychic powers, the Librarian is able to unleash withering blasts of searing energy at his foe, reducing them to ashes with but a thought. Often, the energies are directed and multiplied through the blade of a specially crafted weapon such as a force sword or halberd, with which even the mightiest of foes might be cut down as wheat before the scythe. Death can be unleashed from afar as well, for the Librarian is able to project his powers at distant enemies, launching deadly bolts from a staff, an outstretched hand, or through his very gaze. Unlike conventional weapons, a Librarian’s wrath cannot be parried and does not run out of ammunition. The only limit on a Librarian’s powers is his own will, and this is as strong as any of the Imperium’s mightiest heroes. Librarians are also the guardians of the secrets of the Deathwatch. Within each Watch Fortress is to be found the sealed Vault which stores weapons and relics too dangerous to be allowed to fall into the hands of Mankind’s enemies. Also within the Vault is an archive of forbidden knowledge—multiple stasis chambers contain ancient tomes, engraved tablets, data-crystals, and mnemonic banks. Not even the Watch Commander has access to these archives—only the Librarians are entrusted with their access codes, and only they are judged strong enough to withstand the sanity shattering secrets sealed within. It is only in the direst of circumstances that a Librarian will enter the Vault archive, for each time he does so he is exposed to the whispering voices of long-dead alien beings, tempting him with the power to rule the whole of Humanity in the name of ancient and blasphemous gods. Nevertheless, so terrible are many of the horrors faced by the Deathwatch that the Librarian may be required to consult the archives in order to discover some previous record of an enemy’s weakness. Such knowledge can spell the difference between a mission’s success and failure. Another role carried out by a Watch Fortress’s Librarians is that of providing the Watch Commander with counsel. Given their access to forbidden knowledge and their innate understanding of arcane matters, the word of a Librarian rarely goes unheeded in the Watch Commander’s plans. In addition to this, many Librarians are gifted with some degree of prognostication—whether by way of visions, meditation,",

      "content": "Aside from the Battle-Brothers and their superiors, a Chapter contains many more Space Marines who serve as specialists. Some of these, such as the Chaplains, are part of the establishment of a specific company, while others, such as the Techmarines, are part of a separate body within the Chapter, and attached to a battle force as required. Chaplains are mighty warriors and truly inspirational leaders. Their duty is to tend to the spiritual welfare of the brethren, on and off of the battlefield. Many of the sights a Space Marine must witness and many of the fell beings he must face are so infernal that the soul of an ordinary man would be seared to ashes. The ministrations of the Chaplains ensure that Space Marines remain pure of heart, armouring their souls with unshakable faith. Just as the Chaplains see to the spiritual well being of the Battle-Brothers, so the Apothecaries look to their bodily health. These warriors would give their last drop of blood that a Space Marine might continue to fight, and they are able to heal the most grievous of battlefield injuries. The Apothecaries are assigned the most sacred of duties, that of recovering the gene-seed of a fallen Battle-Brother, so that the Chapter’s genetic future might be ensured and his memory lives on in the inheritance of future generations of Space Marines. For the mightiest heroes of a Chapter, even death does not spell the end of service. Even if a Space Marine’s body is crippled so utterly that no hope of healing exists, his broken form may be interred into the ceramite sarcophagus of a Dreadnought, where his will drives a towering engine of destruction. Such heroes are mightily revered by the Space Marines, and the Battle-Brother’s words and deeds are the very stuff of Chapter legend. Those Neophytes who show an affinity for the workings of the machine are assigned to the Forge, where they undergo extensive training in the mastery of all of the Chapter’s weaponry and vehicles. These so-called Techmarines are dispatched to Mars, where they are inducted into the secrets of the Cult Mechanicus by the tech-engines of war. Rank 6 Deathwatch Librarian Advances",

To this end, the\nTactical Marines are masters of a wide range of\ncombat tactics, and they are adept in the use of a\nvariety of weapons and other equipment.\nThe most commonly fielded weapon\namongst the Deathwatch Tactical Marines\nis the bolter, but this is not the standard\nissue weapon carried by other Chapters.\nAlmost every boltgun in the arsenal of\nthe Deathwatch has been crafted to\nthe very highest possible standard, and\nmaintained according to the strictest\nregimes. They are invariably fitted with a device called a\nshot selector, which allows the brother to quickly chamber\none of the many specialised types of bolter ammunition\nthat the Deathwatch utilises, and engage any foe that may\npresent itself.\nIt is the use of this specialised ammunition that makes the\nDeathwatch Tactical Marine such a fearsome and highly flexible\nwarrior. Hellfire rounds for example, have been introduced\nfollowing the lessons learned in costly battles against Hive\nFleet Behemoth, each containing a small payload of mutogenic\nacid that is devastating to organic matter. Dragonfire rounds\nexplode on contact with their foe, erupting in a burst of\nincandescent chemical fire that soon engulfs the target.\nKraken rounds contain a super-dense core that affords them\nimproved range and penetration compared to a conventional\nround, making them ideal against heavily armoured targets.\nMetal Storm rounds are examples of highly sophisticated and\nbarely understood technology, a miniscule proximity detector\ntriggering the round’s detonation microseconds before impact,\nand lacerating the foe with thousands of razor-sharp fragments,\ncausing him to bleed out in seconds. Stalker shells are optimised\nfor range and stealth, allowing a Tactical Marine to use his\nbolter as a makeshift sniper rifle, increasing his flexibility and\nlethality still further.\nThis huge range of ammunition types means that the\nDeathwatch Tactical Marine can face a wide range of foes,\nand the shot selector allows him to switch, even in the heat of\nbattle, from one to the next. Some Tactical Marines,\nhowever, choose to specialise instead of\ntaking this all-round approach. It is\nnot uncommon for one of a Killspecial weapon, such as\na flamer or meltagun\ninto combat.

After all, a\nbolter not cleaned, oiled, blessed,\nand beseeched can scarcely be\nexpected to be reliable in battle,\nand so a Space Marine’s life may\ndepend upon how well such weapons\nare maintained. Techmarines oversee this\nprocess, guiding the battle brothers in the\ncorrect and proper rituals by which the\nwar spirit of each and every weapon is\nappeased.\nOn the battlefield, a Techmarine’s primary role is to effect\nrepairs of damaged equipment, so that it may return to the fight.\nEach Techmarine carries a huge range of highly specialised\nand often arcane tools, sometimes mounted on a servo-arm or\nat the end of a prehensile mechadendrite. With these tools, the\nTechmarine can repair virtually any item of equipment, from\nan overheated plasma pistol to an immobilised Land Raider,\nprovided that some spark of the machine spirit’s essence remains.\nMany battles have been won thanks to a Techmarine recovering\na damaged weapon in this manner, and in their own way they are\noften vital to a mission’s success.\nAlthough many of the weapons carried by Space Marines are\nwonders of technology beyond the dreams of normal men, there\nare some machines that are so exceptional that only a Techmarine\nmay attend them. One of the most unusual of these is the conversion\nbeamer, a rare weapon that works by converting matter to energy\nin a beam that becomes stronger the further it extends and the\nmore matter is converted. It is only by the constant ministrations of\na Techmarine that such a weapon can be utilised—should anyone\nelse attempt to use the weapon, its war spirit might become greatly\nangered and turn its ire upon the wielder instead.\nThere are yet more weapons and items of equipment even\nmore exotic than the conversion beamer. Many are unique,\nand all are sealed within the Vault at the heart of\neach Watch Fortress. Just as the Librarian has\nexclusive access to the reams of forbidden\nknowledge in each of these archives,\nso the Deathwatch Techmarine keeps\nhis portion of the Vault sealed to all\nbut his fellow Techmarines.

It will try to flee and find shelter in whatever way the situation allows. In a starship, for example, it may scuttle into the ducting system. When confronted, the creature’s aim is to try to escape and will only attack if left no avenue for escape or in order to survive.

Most models carry mono-propellant fuel which ignites via a small pilot flame at the tip of the barrel, though self-igniting models utilising binary hypergolic fuels are not unheard of. Once produced, the intense jet that spurts from the barrel creates a torrent of liquid fire, which spreads out in an inferno that burns even underwater, leaving enemies hard-pressed to put out the fire.

When a character wearing an active field is attacked, roll 1d100. If the result is less than or equal to the field’s protection rating, the attack is nullified and has no effect on the protected character (although the attack may have an impact on the character’s surroundings or other nearby characters, such as weapons with the Blast Quality). Fields may also overload. Compare the result of the d100 roll to avoid damage to the field’s Overload Roll. If the result is less than or equal to the listed number, the field is overloaded and ceases to function until it is recharged or repaired (requiring a successful Very Hard (–30) Tech-Use Test). Most Common Astartes force fields overload on a roll of 01–10. Exceptional craftsmanship reduces that threshold to rolls below 05, while a Master-Crafted force field only overloads on a roll of 01.",

Cluster mines achieve this aim by packing triple-intensity fyceline or similarly potent explosives into dozens of micro-explosive nodules that are linked to a single trigger, typically a tripwire or pressure sensor. The networked explosives have a synergistic effect and produce a massive blast when detonated. A standard mine array covers two square metres; this can be increased by linking multiple mine arrays, but the area’s smallest dimension must not be less than one metre for the mines to have their full effect. Cluster mines are designed for even the relatively green Scout squads to plant without extensive training. When setting cluster mines, the character makes a Concealment Test, receiving a +20 bonus if he is also trained in Demolitions. Note the degrees of success, as any character about to pass through a mined area Opposes those successes with an Awareness Test. If the potential victim wins the contest, he may stop short to avoid the mines. If he fails, he and anyone else in the mined area take 4d10 X Damage with a Penetration of 4. A successful Demolitions Test while planting mines allows for more sophisticated trigger techniques such as time-delays. These booby traps are particularly effective when used to damage the vulnerable underside of most vehicles. Cluster mines double their Penetration to any vehicle in their area of effect.",

Ultimately, this comes down to a judgement call on the GM’s part, based on the circumstances and the Actions of the various combatants leading up to the encounter. The GM should take the following into account when determining Surprise: • Is anyone hiding? Successful use of the Concealment Skill before the combat may mean that some combatants are hidden. Extremely wary characters may oppose this with an Awareness Test. • Is anyone sneaky? Successful use of the Silent Move Skill may have positioned some characters for an ambush. Again, wary opponents may oppose this with an Awareness Test. • Are there any unusual circumstances that would mask the approach of attackers? This can cover nearly anything, from pouring rain to whining engines to nearby explosions. • Are there any distractions? It’s possible that something quite distracting is going on. A cultist’s attention may be so fixated on the sermon of his confessor that he doesn’t notice his attackers approaching. Bearing all of this in mind, the GM must decide which combatants are Surprised. Whilst it’s often the case that one entire side or the other is Surprised, there can be individual exceptions. For example, mutants may easily Surprise a unit of green Guardsmen, but not their keen-eyed commissar. If no one is Surprised, proceed with the combat as normal. A Surprised character loses his Turn in the first Round. He can do nothing except stand dumbfounded. Furthermore, a non-Surprised attacker receives a +30 bonus to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack a Surprised target. After the Surprise Round completely resolves, all Surprised characters recover their wits and can act normally. All combatants then roll for Initiative and the combat proceeds normally.",
