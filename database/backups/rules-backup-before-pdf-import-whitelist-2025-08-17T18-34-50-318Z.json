The forces of darkness pressed in around\nthe guttering flame of humanity, but desperate times called\nfor desperate solutions. Sanguinius of the Blood Angels and\nRogal Dorn of the Imperial Fists, together with their bravest\nwarriors, would accompany the Emperor and take the fight to\nHorus upon his battle-barge, a mighty warship in orbit above\nTerra. The Emperor and his warriors teleported onto Horus’\nbattle-barge but found themselves separated and scattered\nthroughout the corrupt vessel by means of dark sorcery. The\nEmperor fought his way to the Warmaster but was too late to\nsave Sanguinius, who Horus slew when the angelic Primarch\nrefused to turn to Chaos. Yet, some maintain that Sanguinius\ninflicted a wound, however small, upon his erstwhile brother.\nHorus and the Emperor clashed in a battle of both flesh and\nspirit. Horus was filled with the power of the Dark Gods and\ndealt the Emperor a mortal blow, but in the end, the Emperor’s\nwill was the greater, and Horus was struck down with the last\nounce of the Emperor’s strength. The traitor was destroyed\nutterly and, with his death, the power of the Traitor Legions\nwas broken. When Dorn and his warriors finally fought\ntheir way into the rebel warmaster’s sanctum, they found the\nEmperor’s broken and ruined body, and it is said that their\ncries of woe were heard far below on Terra itself.\nRogal Dorn, most determined and unbending of the\nPrimarchs, bore his master’s body back to Terra and, under\nthe direction of the crippled Emperor, bound him within the\nGolden Throne to sustain his existence for all eternity with\nconstant sacrifice and baroque machineries. The followers of\nthe Ruinous Powers were defeated, but it was victory won at a\nterrible cost. The brotherhood of the Primarchs was sundered,\nand the Emperor’s vision for the Imperium and all of Mankind\nlay in ruins—the last, best hope of its fulfilment lost forever.\nThe galactic empire he had forged was all but destroyed, and\nit was to take many more years of brutal warfare before all the\nTraitor forces were defeated and driven into the hellish chaos\nof the Eye of Terror. The toll numbered in the billions, and\nuncounted worlds had been left as little more than corpsehaunted wastelands as the raging inferno of the Horus Heresy\nwas finally extinguished, though Mankind still teetered on the\nvery brink of extinction.\nThe Horus Heresy had revealed weaknesses in the geneseed of several of the early Space Marine Legions, which had\nbeen exacerbated by the need to keep the huge formations\nup to strength in the terrible wars being fought at the time.\nThe insidious powers of Chaos had been able to manipulate\nthis corruption to turn Horus and many of the Space Marines\nunder his command against the Emperor. Once Horus was\ndefeated, it was decided that the forces of the Imperium\nwould be reorganised so that a similar catastrophe could not\nbe repeated.\nThe Space Marine Legions were divided up to create\none Chapter of the same name as the founding Legion and\na number of new Chapters with new names. This event was\ncalled the Second Founding, and over two dozen further\nFoundings have occurred in the ten millennia since. It is\nnot known exactly how many Chapters were created in the\naftermath of the Horus Heresy, as many of the Imperium’s\nrecords are incomplete or lost entirely, and whole Chapters\nhave been created and destroyed in the millennia that have\nfollowed. What is known is that there are just over a thousand\nChapters scattered across the Imperium, each a brotherhood\nof the very finest warriors Humanity can muster.",

The Chapter’s officers might visit the\nculture once a generation and will be the subject of myth and\nlegend. These mighty warriors from beyond the stars are figures\nof awe, and their word is law.\nThe nature of the trials set by the outsiders vary enormously,\nbut all are so arduous that only a handful pass them. Those\nwho fail may be lucky to even survive, for many trials take\nthe form of ritual combat, the hunting of a great beast, or the\nperformance of incredibly dangerous feats of strength and\nbravery. At the conclusion of the trials, those few aspirants that\nhave been deemed worthy are taken away, invariably never to\nsee their people again.\nIt is always a great honour for a family to have a son chosen\nby the Space Marines, even for societies with little conception\nof the greater galaxy beyond their world. The Space Wolves are\nan example of this. The Wolf Priests of the Space Wolves scour\nthe warring tribes of their home world Fenris for their strongest\nand bravest youths, while Ultramarines traditionally draw their\ncandidates from the elite training barracks of a whole group of\nplanetary systems known collectively as Ultramar, the realm of\nthe Ultramarines.\nOther Chapters have no single home world and travel the\ngalaxy in gigantic fleets of battleships, recruiting either from a\nregular series of worlds or from the war zones to which they are\nassigned. The Black Templars are one such example of a fleetbased Chapter, as are the Dark Angels.\nOnce accepted, the young aspirants become Neophytes and\nbegin their regimen of training and biological enhancement.\nEach Chapter has its own traditions regarding the initiation of\nthe recruit into its legends and secrets. This process often runs\nparallel to the bio-genetic treatments the Neophyte must undergo.\nAs the physical transformation proceeds, spiritual change also\noccurs. Both are tempered by ongoing experience on the field of\nbattle and the rituals in which the Neophyte must participate.\nThe nature of such rites varies enormously from one Chapter\nto the next. Some are solemn affairs recalling the sacrifice the\nEmperor made for humanity. Others are raucous celebrations\ndrawing on the culture and nature of the Chapter’s home world.\nStill more are bloody and barbaric involving ritual bloodletting,\nscarification, or amputation. All are vital to the arcane workings\nof the Chapter, and his participation is a prerequisite of the\nNeophyte’s acceptance by his would-be brothers-in-arms.\nSuch are the rigours of the training that many do not survive.\nWhether he is crippled upon the battlefield, or found spiritually\nwanting during a particularly exacting ritual, a Neophyte may\nfind himself cast out, his future with the Chapter curtailed.\nIn some instances, the Neophyte may transgress one of\nthe many articles of Chapter law, and injury at war may prove\npreferable to the punishment. Many possible fates await those\nwho fall by the wayside in this manner. Most are mind-scrubbed\nand become Chapter serfs—manservants and menials. The less\nfortunate are transformed into living servitors—mindless biomechanical automatons who exist only to assist the Chapter’s\nTechmarines in the operation of heavy and frequently dangerous\nmachinery.

    "content": "gene-Seed\nThere are nineteen varieties of gene-seed corresponding to\nthe nineteen different superhuman organs that are surgically\nimplanted into a Space Marine. Because most Chapters have\nexisted for many thousands of years, a number of these\nChapters have gene-seed that has mutated over time. This\nhas resulted in changes in the exact nature of the artificially\ncultured organs. Such changes may sometimes make an\nimplant useless—such is the case with the Imperial Fists, who\nare known to lack the organ called the Betcher’s gland, which\nallows a Space Marine to spit corrosive poison. In other cases,\nthe changes in an organ might reduce its effectiveness or cause\nstrange new effects—the Salamanders, for example, share\nskin as dark as coal, due to the actions of their melanchromic\norgan. Whatever the result, it will affect the entire Chapter,\nas all Space Marines belonging to the Chapter share implants\ncultured from the original gene-seed.\nAlthough a Chapter’s Apothecaries and surgeons are able\nto perform the necessary implant operations, they do not\nnecessarily understand the exact functioning of each organ.\nThe processes involved are incredibly ancient. Procedures\nare handed down from generation to generation, becoming\nincreasingly ritualised and misinterpreted. For these reasons,\nthe efficiency of each organ differs from Chapter to Chapter,\ndepending on the condition of the Chapter’s gene-seed and\nthe degree of debasement of its surgical procedures. In some\nChapters, mutation of gene-seed, poor surgical procedure,\nor inadequate post-operative conditioning has twisted the\nfunctioning of implants.\nIn addition to the problem of mutated implants, many\nChapters have simply lost one or more types of gene-seed\norgans due to accident, genetic failure, or some other cause.\nVery few Chapters, therefore, possess all nineteen of the\nimplants. All possess the carapace implant however, as without\nit, the Neophyte could never become a Space Marine.\nEach of the gene-seed organs is extremely complicated.\nMany of the organs only work properly when another organ\nis present, the loss or mutation of one organ often affecting\nthe exact functioning of the others. For these reasons, implants\nmust be constantly monitored, and many Space Marines must\nundergo corrective surgery to re-balance their metabolisms.",

    "content": "of the recipient’s original heart. This implant enables Space\nMarines to survive low oxygen concentrations and traumatic\ninjury, and is also necessary in the maintenance of the subject’s\nmetabolism, which will be pushed to its limits as his body is\nsubject to the many surgical procedures it will endure over the\nnext several years.\nThe next stage in the implantation process is the addition\nof the Ossmodula. This is a tube-shaped organ whose small\nsize belies its complex structure. The Ossmodula monitors and\nsecretes hormones affecting epiphiseal fusion and ossification\nof the skeleton. At the same time, the specially engineered\nhormones encourage the forming bones to absorb ceramicbased chemicals administered in the Neophyte’s diet. Two\nyears following implantation, this will have caused considerable\nstrengthening of the long bones, extreme ossification of the\nchest cavity (caused by growth of the ribs forming a solid mass\nof inter-laced bone plates), and a general increase in the size of\nthe recipient’s skeleton.\nNormally implanted at the same time as the Ossmodula,\nthe Biscopea is emplaced within the chest cavity. It is small,\napproximately spherical and, like the Ossmodula, its primary\nfunction is hormonal. The presence of the Biscopea stimulates\nmuscle growth throughout the body. These muscles bond to\nthe rapidly growing skeleton, which is why these two implants\nare often undergone at the same time.\nPhases four and five are often implanted at the same time,\nbetween the ages of twelve and fourteen. The Haemastamen\nis a tiny organ, placed within a main blood vessel and serves\ntwo main purposes. Firstly, it monitors and to some degree\ncontrols the Ossmodula and the Biscopea. It also alters the\nconstituent make-up of the recipient’s blood. As a result, the\nSpace Marine’s blood will be considerably more efficient than\nordinary human blood, as it has to be considering the extra\nbiological hardware the Space Marine carries inside him.\nThe second implant emplaced at this time is the Larraman’s\b\nOrgan. This is a liver-shaped, dark, fleshy organ. It is implanted\ninto the chest cavity along with a complicated array of blood\nvessels. The organ generates and stores special Larraman cells.\nIf the recipient is wounded, these cells are released into the\nbloodstream, where they latch onto leucocytes in the blood\nand are transported to the site of the wound. Once outside\nthe body, the Larraman cells form a skin substitute of instant\nscar tissue, staunching the flow of blood and protecting any\nexposed wound area. This process is almost instantaneous, and\nit can appear to the onlooker as if the blood is frozen solid\neven before it hits the ground.\nWith the initiation of phase six, the subject is ready to begin\nthe extensive hypnotherapy that will continue throughout\nthe entire initiation process, and beyond. The Catalepsean\b\nNode is a brain implant usually inserted into the back of the\nskull via a hole drilled into the occipital bone. The pea-sized\norgan influences the circadian rhythms of sleep and the body’s\nresponse to sleep deprivation. Normally, a Space Marine sleeps\nlike any normal man, but if deprived of it, the Catalepsean\nNode becomes active. The recipient is capable of sleeping\nand remaining awake at the same time by switching off areas\nof the brain sequentially. This process cannot replace normal\nsleep entirely, but it increases a Space Marine’s survivability by\nallowing awareness of the environment whilst resting.\nThe next three phases of the process, the implantation\nof the Preomnor, Omophagea and Multi-lung are often\nundertaken at the same time, between the ages of fourteen\nand sixteen. The Preomnor is a large implant which fits into\nthe chest cavity. It is a pre-digestive stomach which allows\nthe recipient to eat a variety of otherwise poisonous or\nindigestible materials. No actual digestion tales place in the\nPreomnor. Instead, individual sensory tubes assess potential\npoisons and neutralise them or, where necessary, isolate the\nPreomnor from the rest of the digestive tract. The Omophagea\nis a complicated implant that is placed within the spinal cord\nbetween the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, where it becomes\nin effect part of the brain. Four nerve sheaths called neuroclea\nare implanted between the spine and the preomnoral stomach\nwall. The Omophagea is designed to absorb genetic material\ngenerated in animal tissue as a function of memory. This\nendows the Space Marine with an unusual survival trait—he\ncan actually learn by eating. If a Space Marine eats part of a\ncreature, he will absorb some of the memories of that creature.\nThis can be very useful in an alien environment. Incidentally, it\nis the presence of this organ which has created the various flesh\neating and blood drinking rituals for which many Chapters are\nknown, as well as giving the names to Chapters such as the\nBlood Drinkers and Flesh Tearers. The third organ implanted\nat this time is the Multi-lung. This large, tubular, grey organ\nis sometimes called the ‘third lung’. Blood is pumped through\nthe organ via connecting vessels grafted onto the recipient’s\npulmonary system. Atmosphere is taken in by means of a\nsphincter located in the trachea. In toxic atmospheres, an\nassociated sphincter muscle closes the trachea and restricts\nnormal breathing, thus protecting the lungs. The Multi-lung is\nable to absorb oxygen from poorly oxygenated or poisonous\nair without suffering damage thanks to its own efficient toxin\ndispersal, neutralisation, and regeneration systems.\nPhase ten of the process is the implantation of the\nOcculobe. This small slug-like organ sits at the base of the\nbrain. It provides the hormonal and genetic stimuli which\nenable a Space Marine’s eyes to respond to optic-therapy. The\nOcculobe does not in itself improve a Space Marine’s eyesight,\nbut it allows technicians to make adjustments to the growth\npatterns of the eye and the light-receptive retinal cells. A Space\nMarine has far better eyesight than a normal human, and can\nsee in low light conditions almost as well as in daylight.\nPhase eleven is the addition of the Lyman’s\bEar. This\norgan enables a Space Marine to consciously enhance and\neven filter certain types of background noise. Not only is\nhearing improved, but a Space Marine cannot become dizzy\nor nauseous as a result of extreme disorientation. A Lyman’s\nEar is externally indistinguishable from a normal human ear.\nBetween the ages of fifteen and sixteen, phase twelve is\ninitiated, in which a flat, circular organ called the Sus-an\b\nMembrane is implanted over the top of the exposed brain.\nIt then grows into the brain tissue until completely merged.\nThe organ is not effective until subsequent chemical therapy\nand training is applied. However, a properly tutored Space\nMarine may then enter into a state of suspended animation.\nThis may be a conscious action, or may happen automatically\nin the event of extreme physical trauma. In this condition,\na Space Marine may survive for many years, even if bearing",

The longest known period of\ndeanimation followed by successful reanimation is 567 years,\nin the case of Brother Silas Err of the Dark Angels Chapter.\nThe next phase of the process is the implantation of the\nMelanchromic\bOrgan. This hemispherical, black organ\nfunctions in an indirect and extremely complex manner. It\nmonitors radiation levels and types bombarding the skin,\nand if necessary, sets off chemical reactions to darken the\nskin and protect it from ultraviolet exposure. It also provides\nlimited protection from other forms of radiation. Differing\nMelanchromic Organ gene-seed from Chapter to Chapter leads\nto variations in skin and hair colour, and in some Chapters all\nof the Space Marines may have identical colouration, such as is\nfound in the albino warriors of the Death Spectres Chapter.\nPhases fourteen and fifteen, the implantation of the Oolitic\b\nKidney and the Neuroglottis, are often undertaken at the\nsame time. The Oolitic Kidney is red-brown and heart-shaped\nand improves and modifies the Space Marine’s circulatory\nsystem, enabling other implants to function effectively. The\nOolitic Kidney also filters blood extremely efficiently and\nquickly. The Secondary Heart and Oolitic Kidney are able to\nact together, performing an emergency detoxification function\nin which the Space Marine is rendered unconscious as his\nblood is circulated at high speed. This enables a Space Marine\nto survive poisons and gases which are otherwise too much\nfor even the multi-lung to cope with. The Neuroglottis enables\nthe Space Marine to assess a potential food by taste. The organ\nis implanted in the back of the mouth. By chewing, or simply\nby tasting, a Space Marine can detect a wide variety of natural\npoisons, some chemicals and even the distinctive odours of\nsome creatures. To some degree, a Space Marine is also able to\ntrack a target by taste alone.\nIn phase sixteen, normally at age sixteen, a small organ\ncalled the Mucranoid is implanted in the lower intestine\nwhere its hormonal secretions are absorbed by the colon.\nThese secretions initiate a modification of the sweat glands.\nThis modification normally makes no difference to the Space\nMarine until activated by appropriate chemical therapy. As\na result of this treatment, the Space Marine sweats an oily,\nnaturally cleansing substance which coats the skin. This\nprotects the Space Marine against extremes of temperature\nand even offers a slight degree of protection against vacuum.\nMucranoid chemical therapy is standard procedure in long\nspace voyages and when fighting in vacuum or near-vacuum.\nPhase seventeen is the implantation of two identical organs\ncalled Betcher’s\bGlands. These are placed into the lower\nlip, alongside the salivary glands or into the hard palette. The\nBetcher’s Gland works in a similar way to the poison gland of\nvenomous reptiles by synthesising and storing deadly poison.\nSpace Marines are rendered immune to this poison by virtue\nof the gland’s presence. The gland allows the Space Marine to\nspit a blinding contact poison, which is also highly corrosive.\nA Space Marine imprisoned behind iron bars could easily\nchew his way out given a few hours.\nIn the penultimate phase of the process, a pair of glands\ncalled Progenoids are implanted, one in the neck and the\nother deep in the chest cavity. This takes place between the age\nof sixteen and eighteen. These glands are vitally important to\nthe very survival of the Space Marine’s Chapter. Each organ\ngrows within the Space Marine, absorbing hormonal stimuli\nand genetic material from the other implants. After five years,\nthe neck gland is mature and ready for removal. After ten\nyears, the chest gland becomes mature and is also ready to\nbe removed. A gland may be removed any time after it has\nmatured, and it represents the Chapter’s only source of geneseed. When mature, each organ contains a single gene-seed\ncorresponding to each zygote implanted into the recipient.\nOnce removed by surgery, the Progenoid must be carefully\nprepared, its individual gene-seeds checked for mutation, and\nsound gene-seeds stored. Gene-seeds can be stored indefinitely\nunder suitable conditions.\nSpace Marine Apothecaries carry a special device known\nas a reductor, which they can use in battlefield conditions to\nremove the Progenoid glands of a fallen Space Marine, so\nthat, even should he die before his glands are harvested, they\nmay be recovered. The whole purpose of the Progenoid is to\nprovide gene-seed to enable the Chapter to continue. It is not\npossible to create a zygote in any other way. Each Chapter’s\nstock of gene-seed is therefore unique to itself. Gene-seed has\na great deal of religious significance to a Chapter, representing\nits identity and future. Without gene-seed, a Chapter has no\nfuture. The extinction of a type of gene-seed means that a\nzygote has been lost forever. The extinction of the Progenoid\ngene-seed itself would effectively mean the end to a Chapter.\nAs each Space Marine has only two Progenoid glands,\nthe rate at which a Chapter can create new Space Marines\nis restricted. It may take many years for a Chapter to rebuild\nitself after heavy losses. Gene-seed is often rendered useless if\na Space Marine is exposed to high radiation levels or other\nforms of genetic disturbance. The efficiency of different\nChapters’ Progenoid gene-seed also varies, so some Chapters\nare able to make up their numbers faster than others.\nThe final and the most distinctive implant is the Black\b\nCarapace, which cannot be implanted beyond the age of\neighteen. This looks like a film of black plastic when growing\nin the tanks. This is removed from its culture-solution and cut\ninto sheets, which are implanted directly beneath the skin of\nthe recipient’s torso. Within a few hours, the tissue expands,\nhardens on the outside, and sends invasive neural bundles\ndeep inside the subject. After several months, the recipient is\nfitted with neural sensors and transfusion points, cut into the\nhardened carapace. These artificial interface points mesh with\nfeatures integral to the power armour, such as the monitoring,\nmedicinal, and maintenance units. Without the benefit of the\nBlack Carapace, a Space Marine’s power armour would be far\nless effective.",

    "content": "chainsword. Optionally, two of the Space Marines may carry\nplasma pistols. This combination is ideal for fast-attacking,\nclose-quarter fighting assault troops.\nEven though Tactical squads are the most common type\nin any Chapter, to earn a place in one a Space Marine must\nhave proven himself both courageous and wise in battle.\nThroughout his service in the Devastator and Assault squads,\nhe will be proven adaptable in his approach to the arts of war\nand will have mastered a range of tactics and weaponry.\nTactical squads are the most commonly fielded squad\ntypes in a Chapter. A Tactical squad is led by a Sergeant and\nincludes nine other Space Marines. Of these, seven BattleBrothers are armed with bolters, whilst the remaining two\ncan be armed with bolters or, alternatively, one may carry a\nheavy weapon such as a missile launcher or a heavy bolter,\nand the other may carry a special weapon such as a flamer or\nmeltagun. This combination is the most tactically flexible and\noffers a good mixture of capabilities within the squad.\nAfter serving in hundreds of campaigns and thousands of\nbattles, and having conquered the very worst the galaxy has\nto throw at him, a Space Marine is likely to be considered a\nVeteran. In most Chapters, such an honour is not measured\nby length of service, but in blood spilled, horrors overcome,\nand mighty deeds done. As a prelude to service in the First\n(Veteran) Company, many Space Marine Veterans fulfill the\nrole of Sergeant, leading squads of all types in any of the\nother companies. Thus, many of the Space Marines of the\nVeteran company will be battle-proven leaders as well as\nhighly experienced warriors.\nThe warriors of the Veteran company are fielded in one of\nthree squad types:\nTerminator squads wear the uniquely powerful Terminator\narmour, sometimes called tactical dreadnought armour. This\narmoured suit is massive in construction, virtually turning a\nSpace Marine into a one-man tank. Every Chapter has a limited\nnumber of Terminator armour suits, and each is an ancient\nartefact crafted many thousands of years ago. Terminators are\nless mobile than other Space Marines and are primarily used\nin boarding actions or in extreme close quarters when heavy\nfire support cannot be easily brought to bear. So resilient is\nthe armour that it is reputedly able to operate inside plasma\nreactors, within volcanoes, and inside highly irradiated areas\nof deep space. Legend has it that the armour can even survive\nthe tread of a Titan. To wear an ancient suit of Terminator\narmour is one of the greatest honours to which a Space\nMarine can aspire. Each suit bears on its left shoulder the Crux\nTerminatus, the unique badge of the Terminator. Each Crux is\nsaid to contain at its core a tiny fragment of the armour worn\nby the Emperor himself when he fought his final battle against\nthe traitor Warmaster Horus, providing a direct link between\nthe Space Marine and the Father of Mankind.\nDespite its obvious benefits, Terminator armour is not\nsuitable for all missions. Most of the time, Veterans take to the\nfield wearing ordinary power armour, albeit a suit inscribed\nwith many hundreds of battle honours. When wearing power\narmour, Veterans are formed into vanguard Veteran squads or\nsternguard Veteran squads. By dint of their rank, Veterans have\naccess to the most fearsome weaponry in the Chapter’s arsenal,\nincluding sacred blades and artificer-crafted combi-weapons\nof uniquely masterful craftsmanship. Vanguard Veteran\nsquads go to battle equipped with the most lethal of close\ncombat weapons, and often wear jump packs to bring them\nto bear before the enemy can even react. Sternguard Veteran\nsquads carry a wide array of ranged weaponry and specialised\nammunition, and are masters in its overwhelming application.\nVeteran squads are rarely deployed en masse, but are instead\nused to bolster the line, provide an unstoppable speartip or to\nact as a highly flexible and mobile reserve.\nMASTERS OF THE cHAPTER\nEach of the Chapter’s ten companies is led by a Captain.\nThese leaders are second in experience only to the Chapter\nMaster himself, and each is a warrior so deadly that he will\nrarely meet his match. Each Captain is an inspirational and\ndetermined leader, able to coordinate the Space Marines under\nhis command whatever the opposition. In addition to leading\nSpace Marines in battle, each Captain holds titles dependent\non his other responsibilities with regard to the workings of\nthe Chapter or its home world, such as Master of the Fleet or\nMaster of the Marches.\nOf the thousand awesome and terrifying warriors that\ncomprise a Space Marine Chapter, there is but one Chapter\nMaster, a leader with centuries of experience in the very\ncrucible of battle. His own fighting skills will be unsurpassed,\nwhether in the use of gun, blade, or bare hands. His very\nrank speaks of a past littered with the bodies of bloodied,\nbeaten foes of the most terrifying and inhuman sort. It is not\nenough, however, for the Chapter Master to be its foremost\nwarrior. He must also be a superb tactician, grounded in the\nteachings of the Codex Astartes and honed through countless\ndecisions made in the maelstrom of close action. His soldiers\nare also his brothers, and he knows that they will give their\nlives at his command. He must preserve these magnificent\nfighters, but must also accomplish his mission and uphold the\nhonour of his Chapter. He will be steeped in the lore of his\nChapter and be sworn to keep its secrets and must conduct\nhis diplomacy accordingly, for Space Marines maintain a web\nof time-proven oaths and honours debts and do not simply\nheed the commands of Imperial functionaries. Those who\nwish a Chapter Master to send his warriors into battle must\ngive him good reason to do so. In addition to this, a Chapter\nMaster will often be the ruler of his Chapter’s home world, a\nresource that is too valuable for him to ignore. Amongst the\ngreatest risks facing a Chapter Master is the very power he\nwields, for a Chapter of Space Marines is a force capable of\ndevastating entire worlds at his order.\nEven a Space Marine can feel pride, ferocity, and desire—\nit is, after all, their hero’s soul that drives them to acts of\nselfless sacrifice. But in these things lie the seeds of hubris\nthat can eventually lead to damnation. Any Space Marine, but\nespecially a Chapter Master, must beware the short path to\nvictory, must consider both the ends and the means, and must\nheed the example of Emperor and Primarch.",

However, if you\nhave difficulty coming up with a name on the spot (like many\nother gamers!), this section will help guide you in creating a\ngreat name for your Space Marine.\nNames within the 41st Millennium are as varied as the\nmany thousands of worlds that make up the Imperium. As\nmankind is an inventive and contrary creature, there are no\nstandard or universal conventions that govern the names\npeople give themselves. In some places, a single simple name\nmight indicate low birth and ignominy, whilst in others,\nit might act as a mark of extreme wealth, fame, and good\nbreeding. When deciding upon a name, feel free to mix and\nmatch any of the suggestions made by the naming tables. The\nidea, of course, is to create a name that suits your character—\nand no one knows more about your character than you do!\nother warhaMMer 40,000 roleplaY CharaCterS anD DeathwatCh\nThe most important information for players of Dark heresy and rogue traDer is that Deathwatch uses the same\ncore mechanics and takes place in the same universe. There are some theme-related differences in the rules between these\ngames, but Dark heresy and rogue traDer players should feel right at home with the way the game itself works.\nIt is important to note that Deathwatch Space Marines are quite powerful (particularly in combat!) in relation to\nDark heresy and rogue traDer characters. A rogue traDer character with 14,000 xp is roughly equivalent to a\nRank 1 Deathwatch Space Marine (in that the Rogue Trader has a great deal of power tied up in his wealth and personal\nstarship!), and a Dark heresy character using an Ascended Career from ascension with 14,000 xp is also roughly equal\n(having his own strengths in regards to Influence, many knowledge and investigative skills, and so forth). It is strongly\nrecommended that the GM consider carefully before mixing Space Marines into Dark heresy and rogue traDer\ncampaigns, because the Space Marine’s combat abilities are significantly higher than any other type of character.\nDark heresy characters using ascension are particularly recommended if you wish to combine the two games. An\nOrdo Xenos Inquisitor and his trusted Throne Agents are quite appropriate to accompany a Deathwatch Space Marine\n(or even an entire Kill-team) on a mission, or set of missions, of particular import.\nrequiSition & warhaMMer 40,000 roleplaY\nIt is assumed that, in Deathwatch, characters from other Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay games have some special\ndispensation to accompany the Space Marines on their missions (for instance, if one of the player characters is an\nInquisitor). Throne Gelt and a Rogue Trader’s Profit Factor have no meaning for the Deathwatch. Therefore, the other\ncharacters also benefit from the Requisition rules and may acquire Renown at the GM’s discretion (see pages 138–141\nfor more information about Requisition and Renown).\nIf a Deathwatch character joins a Dark heresy or rogue traDer game, the GM is encouraged to determine a\nfair method of applying Requisition to the Space Marine character rather than participating in Profit Factor, Influence,\nor Throne Gelt (all of these terms are explained in rogue traDer, ascension, and Dark heresy, respectively).

These qualities served him well when he reunited with the Emperor and led the Dark\nAngels Legion in the Great Crusade. One of the great tragedies of the Horus Heresy is that while Jonson earned\nglory amongst the stars, Luther, his closest friend and trusted second in command, turned against him, leading\nthose Space Marines who remained on Caliban to the service of Chaos. Returning to Caliban, Jonson discovered\nhis blood-brother’s treachery. So terrible was his vengeance, so bitter his sense of betrayal, that the ensuing battle\nsaw the destruction of Caliban itself.

The idea that outsiders are not to be trusted is drilled into\nthe recruits from an early stage, and they are tested continuously to ensure their compliance until it becomes second nature.\nAfter all, a brother who cannot be entirely trusted to keep the Chapter’s secrets is unlikely to advance through its ranks.\nAlthough the Dark Angels have fought beside all of the branches of the Imperium’s vast military machine, they prefer\nto stand beside other Space Marines. Many, even brother Astartes, find the Dark Angels aloof and uncommunicative. The\nDark Angels, for their part are impatient and unforgiving with strangers who pry into their affairs. In truth, those Dark\nAngels who are aware of the existence of the Fallen are ever watchful for any sign of their activity, and will abandon\nwhatever mission they are about should they gain any clue that one is nearby. In theory, even a Dark Angel seconded to\nthe Deathwatch could go “off mission” in this manner, although the annals of Watch Fortress Erioch do not relate any such\nincident taking place.\nThe Dark Angels are also notoriously intolerant of non-humans and will often refuse to fight alongside armies that\ninclude abhuman warriors or alien races. They are highly suspicious of outsiders and often appear unreasonably aloof and\nintransigent. Indeed, there have been a number of occasions where Dark Angels have withdrawn suddenly and with no\nexplanation from a warzone when confronted by an Inquisitor or missionary.\nDespite such incidents, many Dark Angels have served with distinction and honour in the Deathwatch. Their taciturn\nnature and stubborn refusal to accept anything other than total victory over their foes has served the Deathwatch well, and\nseveral noted Watch Commanders are drawn from the Chapter. These keep in close contact with one another, coordinating\nthe efforts of the Deathwatch across entire sectors of the Imperium.",

To this end, the\nTactical Marines are masters of a wide range of\ncombat tactics, and they are adept in the use of a\nvariety of weapons and other equipment.\nThe most commonly fielded weapon\namongst the Deathwatch Tactical Marines\nis the bolter, but this is not the standard\nissue weapon carried by other Chapters.\nAlmost every boltgun in the arsenal of\nthe Deathwatch has been crafted to\nthe very highest possible standard, and\nmaintained according to the strictest\nregimes. They are invariably fitted with a device called a\nshot selector, which allows the brother to quickly chamber\none of the many specialised types of bolter ammunition\nthat the Deathwatch utilises, and engage any foe that may\npresent itself.\nIt is the use of this specialised ammunition that makes the\nDeathwatch Tactical Marine such a fearsome and highly flexible\nwarrior. Hellfire rounds for example, have been introduced\nfollowing the lessons learned in costly battles against Hive\nFleet Behemoth, each containing a small payload of mutogenic\nacid that is devastating to organic matter. Dragonfire rounds\nexplode on contact with their foe, erupting in a burst of\nincandescent chemical fire that soon engulfs the target.\nKraken rounds contain a super-dense core that affords them\nimproved range and penetration compared to a conventional\nround, making them ideal against heavily armoured targets.\nMetal Storm rounds are examples of highly sophisticated and\nbarely understood technology, a miniscule proximity detector\ntriggering the round’s detonation microseconds before impact,\nand lacerating the foe with thousands of razor-sharp fragments,\ncausing him to bleed out in seconds. Stalker shells are optimised\nfor range and stealth, allowing a Tactical Marine to use his\nbolter as a makeshift sniper rifle, increasing his flexibility and\nlethality still further.\nThis huge range of ammunition types means that the\nDeathwatch Tactical Marine can face a wide range of foes,\nand the shot selector allows him to switch, even in the heat of\nbattle, from one to the next. Some Tactical Marines,\nhowever, choose to specialise instead of\ntaking this all-round approach. It is\nnot uncommon for one of a Killteam’s Tactical Marines to carry a\nspecial weapon, such as\na flamer or meltagun\ninto combat. Such\nweapons do not have",

Understanding these\nmarkings allows a broad understanding of their meaning, such\nas where a tribe has marked its boundaries or areas they have\nmarked as dangerous.\nDeathwatch: Kill-teams often develop their own shorthand\ncommunication to allow them to converse quickly and\nsecretively in the presence of others. This is especially useful\nwhen dealing with other arms of the Imperial war machine,\nwhere the goals of the Deathwatch may not coincide with\nthose of the Imperial Guard or Navy.\nChapter Runes: Each Chapter of the Adeptus Astartes has\nits own form of ciphers used to communicate between its BattleBrothers. These closely guarded secrets are almost never taught\nto those outside the Chapter and constitute a reliable way for\nthose within the Chapter to quickly identify each other.\nImperial Codes: Both the Imperial Navy and the Imperial\nGuard employ a battle language which comprises mostly of\nnumbers and acronyms.

This Skill Group applies to all ciphers used by\nacolytes and throne agents of the Inquisition.\nMercenary Cant: Many mercenary companies operate\nin the Imperium, and each has an abbreviated, clipped battle\nlanguage for orders and commands.

The psyker and anyone within 4d10 metres of him must\nmake an Easy (+30) Agility or Strength Test to avoid being knocked to the ground.\n45–47\nBloody Tears: Blood weeps from stone and wood within 3d10 metres of the psyker.

Everyone within\n3d10 metres of the psyker must make a Routine (+10) Willpower Test or be Stunned for 1 Round.\n14–18\nPsy-Blast: There is an explosion of power and the psyker is thrown 1d10 metres into the air, falling to the ground.\n(See page 261 for rules on Falling Damage).\n19–24\nSoul Sear: Warp power courses through the psyker’s body, scorching his soul. The psyker cannot use any powers for\n1 hour and gains 5 Corruption Points.\n25–30\nLocked In: The power cages the psyker’s mind in an ethereal prison. The psyker falls to the ground in a catatonic\nstate. Each Round thereafter, he must spend a Full Action and make a Difficult (–10) Willpower Test. On a success,\nhis mind is freed and restored to his body.\n31–38\nChronological Incontinence: Time warps around the psyker. He winks out of existence and reappears in 1d10\nRounds (or in 1 minute in narrative time). The psyker suffers 1d5 Insanity Points and 1d5 permanent Toughness\ndamage.\n39–46\nPsychic Mirror: The psyker’s power is turned back on him. Resolve the power’s effects as normal, but the power\ntargets the psyker instead. If the power is beneficial, it instead deals 1d10+5 Energy Damage to the psyker and the\nbeneficial effect is cancelled. Armour is ignored by the damage unless it is warded.\n47–55\nWarp Whispers: The voices of Daemons fill the air within 4d10 metres of the psyker, whispering terrible secrets and\nshocking truths. Everyone in the area (including the psyker) must make a Hard (–20) Willpower Test or gain 1d10\nCorruption Points.\n56–58\nVice Versa: The psyker’s mind is thrown out of his body and into another nearby creature or person. The psyker\nand a random being within 50 metres of him (note that this cannot be a Daemon, Untouchable or other ‘soulless’\ncreature) swap consciousnesses for 1d10 Rounds. The affected being may be an ally or even an enemy combatant.\nEach individual retains his Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship during the\nswap, but all other Characteristics are the same as those of the new host body. If either body is slain, the effect ends\nimmediately. Both affected individuals gain 1d5 Insanity Points from the experience. If there are no beings within\nrange, the psyker must make a Willpower Test or become catatonic for 1d5 Rounds while his mind wanders the Warp.\nHe gains 2d10 Insanity Points from this journey.\n59–67\nRending the Veil: The air vibrates with images of cackling Daemons, and the kaleidoscopic taint of the Warp is\nrendered visible. All sentient creatures (including the psyker) within 1d100 metres of the psyker must test against Fear\n(3). This effect lasts for 1d5 rounds.\n68–72\nBlood Rain: A psychic storm of howling winds erupts, and a torrential rain of blood covers an area within 5d10\nmetres of the psyker. Anyone within this area (including the psyker himself ) must pass a Challenging (+0) Strength\nTest or be knocked to the ground. If anyone uses Psychic Powers within this area, they automatically invoke a Perils\nof the Warp Test. The storm lasts for 1d5 Rounds\n73–78\nCataclysmic Blast: The psyker’s power overloads, arcing out in great bolts of warp energy. Anyone within 1d10\nmetres of the psyker (including the psyker himself ) takes 1d10+5 Energy Damage. The psyker may use no further\npowers for 1d5 hours after this event.\n79–82\nA Hole in the World: A Vortex of Doom with a PR of 2d10 (see page 195) springs into existence within 1d10\nmetres of the psyker. It then begins to move randomly (roll 1d10 for the number of metres it moves and use the scatter\ndiagram on page 248 for direction), devouring all in its path. The Vortex lasts for 1d5 Rounds and then vanishes.\n83–86\nLost to the Warp: The psyker must make an immediate Very Hard (–30) Willpower Test. If he fails, he is\nimmediately dragged into the Warp by a Daemon, which possesses him and uses his body for vile purposes. The\npsyker appears on an inhabited planet 1d10 weeks later with dim memories of the horrific acts he has performed while\npossessed. He gains 4d10 Corruption Points, and may experience complications caused by his actions while possessed.\nHe may receive a visit from the Inquisition if his fate becomes known to that organisation. From now on, the psyker\nmust adjust all Perils of the Warp checks by +10 due to his body serving as a conduit for blasphemous forces.\n87–90\nReality Quake: Reality buckles around the psyker, and an area within 3d10 metres of him is sundered. Solid objects\nalternately rot, burn, and freeze, and everyone and everything in the area takes 2d10 Rending damage. Warded objects\nand Untouchables suffer half the damage rolled.\n91–99\nSomething is Coming...: With a blood curdling howl, a Daemon Prince (see Chapter XIII: Adversaries) rips into\nexistence within 3d10 metres of the psyker. It detests the psyker and trains its attacks on the fool that unwittingly\nsummoned it. Only its destruction or the death of the psyker will send it back to the Warp.",

    "content": "“On this world, my word shall be heeded as that of the Emperor. The\nsouls of my subjects belong to Him, but their bodies belong to me.”\n–King Lamok, Imperial Commander and ruler of Woebetide\nThe vast majority of the Imperium’s worlds are ruled by\nan individual called an Imperial Commander or Imperial\nGovernor. Those that are not are most likely to fall under the\ndirect control of one of the Imperium’s organisations, such as\nthe Space Marines or the Adeptus Mechanicus, and in such\ncases a senior member of that organisation holds the additional\nrank of Imperial Commander.\nEach world in the Imperium is, to all intents and purposes,\nautonomous. Of course, this self-rule is subject to various\nconditions, the greatest of which is that its leader renders due\ntithes to the Imperium, in the form of resources and military\nunits, and maintains a strict cull of its psyker population.\nBeyond these responsibilities, planets are largely free to\nadminister themselves as they see fit.\nAlthough every planet has an individual who holds the\nrank of Imperial Commander, the exact form of governance\nvaries enormously. On most worlds, the Imperial Commander\nhas inherited the title from a long line of predecessors, perhaps\nbeing able to trace the lineage back to the world’s first colonists,\nliberators or conquerors. Other planets are ruled by a council,\nthe chair of which holds the rank of Imperial Commander so\nlong as he presides. On a small number of worlds the populace\ndecides who will rule them, though such regimes rarely survive\nin the age of war that is the 41st Millennium.\nAlthough each world is effectively independent, the\nImperium is divided up into sectors and sub-sectors. The\nworlds of these regions are often interdependent to some\ndegree. For example densely populated Hive worlds rely\non nearby agricultural worlds to feed their populations.\nEven if not directly dependent, there exists some manner\nof federation, for the benefit of trade and mutual defence,\nwhich is normally presided over by a Sector Lord, a powerful\nindividual appointed by the Adeptus Terra. Sector Lords do\nnot have direct control over Imperial Commanders and their\nworlds, but they do have a lot of control over trade and other\nmatters affecting how the world interacts with the Imperium at\nlarge, a fact that often gives them great influence and leverage\nover Imperial Commanders that rely on other planets to\nsustain themselves.\nThe Administratum has devised a characteristically complex\nsystem for cataloguing the functions of the Imperium’s worlds.\nWhile some relate to the world’s environment, most describe\nthe function the planet serves within the Imperium itself.

From the\ninductee-cadet learning for the first time how to field-strip his lasgun,\nto the most accomplished Chapter Master of the Adeptus Astartes.\nAll of us must fight, or all of us shall die.”\n–Fundaments of Service, Verse I.\nEvery world in the Imperium must look first to its own defence,\nfor aid against external aggression or mass uprising can take\nmonths to arrive, by which time the Imperial Commander’s head\nis likely to be mounted upon a spike over the burned out ruins\nof his former palace. In order to defend against pirate attack,\nrebellion, alien invasion or any other threat, each world maintains\nsome form of planetary militia. The number and nature of such\na force varies enormously, dependent upon the type of world. A\ndensely packed Hive world, for example, is able to raise many\nmillions of troops, and due to its huge industrial base is likely to\nbe able to equip its forces well. A less populated world is able to\nraise far fewer troops, but may be able to make up for the lack of\nnumbers in specialised skills. The Jungle Fighters of the Death\nworld of Catachan are a case in point. Few warriors in the entire\ngalaxy are able to match them in their native environment, and\nthey are such tough and determined soldiers that their skills are\never in demand regardless of the nature of the warzone.\nIn addition to his duty of providing troops, the Imperial\nCommander must also render heavy equipment, in the form of\ntanks, troops transports, artillery, and the like. Due to the nature\nof the Standard Template Construct, these are likely to be of\na standardised type common to most worlds in the Imperium.\nSometimes a world may produce equipment of an unusual pattern,\nbut these rarely join the ranks of the Imperial Guard due to the\ndifficulties in maintaining them. The Imperial Commander is\nalso obliged to provide massive reserves of arms and ammunition\nto the regiments raised from his world, and to maintain such\nstocks against future emergencies in nearby warzones.\nPlanetary defence forces go by any number of names and\nare organised and equipped according to the vagaries of local\ncustom. Some appear more ceremonial than functional, wearing\ngaudy uniforms and ornate armour, yet are recruited from highly\naccomplished warrior classes. The warriors of other militias\nappear more like rag-tag bandits, but are nonetheless hard bitten\nveterans and the match for any Imperial Guard unit.\nWhen required to provide troops for the Imperial Guard,\nthe Officio Munitorum demands the very best of an Imperial\nCommander’s defence forces. Withholding his elite units has\nproven the downfall of many an Imperial Commander, for often\nhe is held accountable for the performance of those troops he\nhas provided. If required by ongoing wars to provide more\nregiments, it is quite possible for a world’s militia to be stripped\nof its manpower entirely, making mass conscription a necessity,\nregardless of the effects on the planet’s economy.\nUpon joining the ranks of the Imperial Guard, the troopers of\nthe defence forces may come into contact for the very first time\nwith a whole range of troops they have never seen before. They\nmay fight beside lumbering Ogryns or stealthy Ratlings, and\nmay even share a battlefield with the legendary Space Marines.",

The Chapter’s origins are even more shrouded in\nsecrecy, for they are born of a solemn pact made between the\nInquisition and the Adeptus Astartes.\nCenturies ago, a conclave of Inquisitor Lords—the\nApocryphon Conclave of Orphite IV—convened with the\nsole purpose of formulating an Imperium-wide strategy to\ncombat the many xenos threats that assailed Mankind. The\nmembers of this conclave were, in the main, drawn from the\nranks of the Ordo Xenos, all of whom shared the belief that\none day, there would come a time when Humanity would be\nconsumed by slavering xenos beasts, or enslaved to creatures\nof unutterably alien origins. They foresaw an age when every\nalien life form in the galaxy, and others from beyond it, might\nrise up and the Age of the Imperium would come to an end.\nThey had no inkling when such a terrible age might come,\nbut they knew with dreadful certainty that it surely would,\nand they determined that no effort should be spared to avert\nsuch an end.\nThe conclave sat for many years, and bitter debate raged\nback and forth between Inquisitor Lords of many different\npositions. Some believed that every trace of alien life should be\npurged from the galaxy, while a few advocated the formation\nof alliances with those races that could be tolerated. Some\nspoke of ancient, god-like beings that have slumbered since\nbefore the creation of Mankind awakening to enslave the\ngalaxy, while others foresaw that death would come at the\nhands of invasion from other galaxies entirely. While many\nInquisitor Lords declared the conclave itself an admission of\ndefeat for even countenancing that Mankind might not prevail\nagainst these threats, wiser counsel prevailed, and a strategy\nwas eventually formulated. The conclave would request an\naudience with the assembled Chapter Masters of the Adeptus\nAstartes, and ask of them a solemn undertaking.\nHow many Chapter Masters assembled to hear the\nwords of the conclave is not known, for such an event has\nonly occurred a handful of times in the long history of the\nImperium. Nor were the words of the Inquisitors recorded\nfor posterity. Certainly, enough Chapter Masters must have\nanswered the call, for a quorum of sorts was convened. The\nconclave presented its prophecy to the Chapter Masters,\nevoking the galaxy-wide threat of the ravening xenos. The\nChapter Masters, every one a veteran of a thousand campaigns\nagainst the terrors of the void, listened to the Inquisitors’\nwords, and withdrew to consider the matter.\nThe results of the Chapter Masters’ deliberations were\ndelivered to the conclave at sunrise the next day. Each of the\nMasters and Inquisitors undertook a solemn oath together.\nThey would form a new Chapter, consisting of veteran Space\nMarines highly experienced in combating the xenos. This\nChapter was dubbed the ‘Deathwatch’, for it would stand\nguard against the doom foretold by the conclave. Thus, to\nthis day, this joint oath still stands. The Battle-Brothers of\nthe Deathwatch take the war against the alien to the very\ndarkest reaches of the void, bringing to bear such force\nas no individual Inquisitor could hope to muster. In this\nmission, the Ordo Xenos and the Deathwatch are equals,\nthe Inquisitors rooting out the foes for the Deathwatch to\neradicate. While neither party is subject to the command of\nthe other, both work in concert towards their common goal,\naccording to those oaths made centuries ago. The two work\nclosely together, ever watchful for that fateful day when the\nprophecies of the conclave are realised.",

    "content": "A Watch Commander and all of the Kill-teams under his\ncommand are based in a Watch Fortress. Such places can take a\ngreat many forms; some are mighty deep space stations, while\nothers are imposing, fortified keeps on a planet’s surface. Some\nare impenetrable installations many miles below ground, while\nothers still are hollowed out asteroids bristling with weaponry\nand protected from prying eyes by arcane cloaking systems.\nWithin each Watch Fortress the Kill-teams train and prepare\nfor coming missions. Each fortress combines the functions of\ncommand centre, keep, archive, garrison and more. The Watch\nCommander often coordinates the monitoring of a hundred\ndifferent threats; or his attentions might be focused exclusively\non one single, overriding concern towards which all of his\nefforts are turned. The commander is assisted in his duties by a\ncadre of specialists, some of whom are Space Marines, such as\nTechmarines, Apothecaries and the likes, while many more are\nthe equivalent of Chapter Serfs. Some are specialists seconded\nfrom the staff of one or more Inquisitors, while the greatest\nnumber are mono-task Servitors.\nAmongst the most important members of the staff are the\nAstropaths, several of whom are always present in any Watch\nFortress. At all times, at least one Astropath is locked in an\narmoured saviour-chamber (sometimes referred to as the ‘ebon\ncoffin’) with its own life-support system, which is isolated from\nthat of the fortress. In the event of the facility being overrun,\nit is intended that this Astropath will survive long enough to\ntransmit a message to the nearest Inquisitorial bastion or Space\nMarine home world. Getting such a message out is far more\nimportant than the Astropath’s survival of course, and many\nhave committed suicide rather than fall into enemy hands, once\nreasonably certain their message has been received. That being\nsaid, one Astropath in the service of the Inquisition is known\nto have survived for six months within his saviour-chamber,\nwhile hideous Drugh slithered around the fortress and rasped\nineffectually at the chamber’s armoured hatch. By the time the\nfortress was retaken, the poor soul was quite insane, and put\nout of his misery soon after.\nThe number of Kill-teams stationed in any given Watch\nFortress varies enormously. Some are home to only a handful\nof Battle-Brothers, while others host several dozen Kill-teams.\nDespite the small number of warriors stationed on even the\nlargest Watch Fortress, it would be suicide for an enemy\nto attempt an attack on one, even if its location could be\ndetermined. Each bristles with weaponry, much of it controlled\nby hard-wired Servitors or fired remotely by the Watch\nCommander’s staff. Some are even said to be protected by\ngreat cannons and banks of missiles controlled by autonomous\nmachine spirits.\nAt the heart of each fortress is to be found a sealed vault,\ncontaining the most sensitive and valuable of assets. It is said\nthat some of these vaults are encased within stasis fields;\nthat time stands still within and even the most ancient and\ncrumbling parchments can be preserved. Other vaults are said\nto be encased within quantum-displacement fields, so that they\nare not actually located in the Watch Fortress at all, but exist out\nof phase with it so that even should the fortress be destroyed\nthe contents at its heart will survive. Exactly what is kept\nwithin these vaults depends upon the mission of the fortress\nand the threats it guards against. Some contain vast libraries\nof forbidden texts, knowledge so terrible they may only be\nconsulted when the very fate of Humanity itself hangs in the\nbalance. Alien artefacts of unknown or devastating potency\nmight also be sealed within the vault, affording the savants of\nthe Ordo Xenos the opportunity to study them whilst they are\nkept out of the hands of those who would use them for the\ndetriment of Mankind. Some Watch Fortresses even maintain\na stock of the most exotic of weapons, which are kept safe in\nthe vault and only brought forth in the most dire of situations.\nHere are found the warheads of the cyclonic torpedoes used to\nenact Exterminatus upon a world. Some weapons are unique\nand so potentially devastating they may never be disturbed, the\nsingular relics of the Dark Age of Technology. This includes\nsuch artefacts as the anti-baryon detonator held in a Watch\nFortress at the heart of the Ghoul Stars, and the super-massive\n‘starbane’ vortex cascade generator secreted within the eonlocked Ormand Repository near the Ring of Fire.\nAside from these sealed stocks of weaponry, each fortress\ncontains vast stores of more conventional arms and ammunition.\nSufficient stores to last for centuries without re-supply are held\nin the Watch Fortresses, as well as all of the heavy equipment\nnormally utilised by the Space Marines such as artillery and\nvehicles. Many of the weapons are venerated relics, crafted by\nlong-dead master-artisans whose names have become legendary\namongst the Space Marines.\nThe larger of the Watch Fortresses are home to all manner\nof training facilities. In vast domes, unique environments can be\nrecreated in which the Battle-Brothers can perfect their battle\ndrill and rehearse their missions. Some of these domes have\nbeen stocked with life forms, such as Death world flora and\nfauna, in order to create the most realistic training conditions\npossible. It has even been known for captured aliens to be set\nloose in the training domes, to be hunted down by the Killteams in deadly mission simulation exercises.\nAlthough no resource is spared the Kill-teams, it is usual\nthat each Battle-Brother lives an austere existence in the Watch\nFortress. It is common for each to maintain a personal shrine,\nat which he undertakes the devotions and rites particular to his\nown Chapter. A Battle-Brother seconded from the Ultramarines\nChapter, for example, might maintain a simple chapel dedicated\nto the Primarch Roboute Guilliman, while one drawn from the\nMortifactors Chapter might keep vigil before the flensed skulls\nof a hundred slain enemies. When not engaged upon a mission\nor a training exercise, and not meditating at his own chapel, the\nSpace Marine may rest in a cell which is seldom more than a\nbare, stone-walled chamber. Space Marines require little sleep\nhowever, and most of the their time is spent either in battle, or\npreparing for it.",

Not all\nof the armour is repainted however, for the right shoulder\nplate is left in its original colour so that the Brother’s parent\nChapter may be known. To obscure one’s Chapter icon is\nregarded as an act that would anger the armour’s war-spirit\ngreatly and invite its ire at a crucial moment in battle. Thus,\nthe origins of any Deathwatch warrior are clearly visible by\nthe heraldry displayed upon his right shoulder.\nOn the warrior’s left shoulder he bears with great pride\nthe ornate heraldry of the Deathwatch. The shoulder plate\nand the entire left arm is electroplated silver, and polished\nto a high shine. At the centre of the plate is the icon of\nthe Deathwatch — the Inquisitorial ‘I’, mounted with a\ndeath’s head and crossed bones. Around the icon passages\nfrom various devotional texts are engraved, including the\nCatechism of the Xenos and the Third Abjuration of Terra.\nSuch passages remind the Brother of his duty at all times, and\nit is not uncommon for him to recant the lines of such prayers\nin battle, steeling his heart and those of his comrades against\nthe evil of the xenos.\nAside from these details, the armour of a Deathwatch\nwarrior is often decorated with a combination of purity seals\nand holy icons and symbols unique to his parent Chapter.\nSpace Wolves, for example, commonly adorn their armour\nwith all manner of runes and talismans derived from the culture\nof their home world of Fenris, and these can often be seen\non the armour of Space Wolves serving in the Deathwatch.\nBlood Angels Space Marines are known to bear many small\nteardrop icons, while the Battle-Brothers of the Dark Angels\nChapter often carry small winged sword pendants.\nThe longer he serves in the Deathwatch, the more adorned\nwith purity seals and devotional scripts a warrior’s armour\nbecomes. Having faced the vilest horrors of the galaxy, the\nBattle-Brother knows that ultimately, it is faith that defeats\nthe xenos.

    "content": "The Inquisition and the Deathwatch have access to a huge\nrange of weapons and artefacts that even the Space Marines\ndo not have. Quite apart from the highly specialised or unique\nitems, every single Deathwatch Space Marine is equipped with\nthe best wargear possible. Every boltgun is an artificer-crafted\nwork of art, created and maintained by the finest weaponsmiths in the galaxy. Every suit of armour has been handed\ndown through generations of warriors, and is imbued with\nthe spirit of each. Every Space Marine that takes up a weapon\ngives unto it something of himself, and in return is blessed\nwith the protection of his forebears.\nMany of the weapons and suits of power armour in the\narmoury of the Deathwatch are revered as holy icons. Many\nhave individual names, taken from a former bearer or a great\ndeed performed. There are boltguns with names such as ‘Brother\nKalk’s Reaper’ and ‘Bane of Piscea’. There are suits of power\narmour called ‘Lord Odeck’s Deliverance’ and ‘Iron Spirit’.\nIn addition to the masterful craftsmanship with which each\nitem of wargear is maintained, much of the equipment of the\nDeathwatch utilises improvements and modifications known\nonly to the most senior of tech-adepts. It is a testament to the\nChapter’s status that it has access to the very highest echelons\nof the Cult Mechanicus, and to technological marvels beyond\neven the reach of the Space Marines. Perhaps the most obvious\nexpression of this access is to be seen in the many types of\nhighly specialised ammunition the Chapter uses. Through\ncountless engagements, the Chapter has developed specialised\npoisons keyed to the biology of specific aliens, and these can be\ndelivered by way of specialised bolt rounds. The Deathwatch\nmakes use of tracking devices that utilise otherwise lost\nbranches of technology, including electro-magnetic scanners,\nmotion detectors and co-efficient prognostication units. Each\nBattle-Brother commonly bears equipment only carried by\nspecialists in his own Chapter, ranging from melta-bombs to\nthe highly prized vortex grenade.",

    "content": "Although counted as a Chapter, the Deathwatch has a highly unusual organisation, which bears little\nresemblance to that laid down in the Codex Astartes. While a regular, ‘Codex’ Chapter is organised so as\nto be highly mobile and flexible, and to be deployed almost anywhere in the galaxy on short notice, the\nDeathwatch often focuses on one threat, in one region. This means that a Watch Commander is able to\ntailor his forces to the task at hand. Some Watch Fortresses stand guard over vast Ork empires, ever ready\nto oppose the nigh-unstoppable invasions they periodically unleash. Others guard against more shadowy\nthreats, far harder to detect yet every bit as dangerous. Still more face a myriad of foes and must constantly\nadapt to an ever-changing strategic situation.\nThe Deathwatch has access to all of the specialised war machines used by other Chapters, and more. Even\nif a Watch Fortress makes no regular use of such equipment, it keeps mothballed stocks of everything from\nattack bikes to strike cruisers, for use as and when required.\nIn structure, the Deathwatch does not adhere to the strict organisation of squads and companies that the Codex\nAstartes dictates. The only relevant tactical unit is the Kill-team, which may be organised and equipped in any\nway the Watch Captains deem appropriate. In one mission the team may go to war on Space Marine bikes, and in\nthe next mounted on a mighty Land Raider. Those Battle-Brothers with the requisite knowledge might go to war\nclad in hulking Terminator armour, or in lightweight Scout armour with chameleonic cloaks. Occasionally, several\nKill-teams are combined into a larger force, a sure sign that a highly dangerous foe is to be faced.\nIt is perhaps inevitable that Space Marines new to a term of service in the Deathwatch might experience\na period in which they must adjust to this foreign mode of organisation. This is especially the case when it\ncomes to Chapters that adhere rigidly to the Codex Astartes, such as the Ultramarines and their Successors.\nIn practice, a Battle-Brother who could not adjust would not be sent to the Deathwatch, and those that\ndo are often the most highly effective of warriors.",

The missions undertaken\nby the Deathwatch are many and varied, and range from standing\nsentinel against a general threat to accompanying an alienhunting Inquisitor in a desperate mission beyond the fringes of\nknown space. Despite the variety of mission profiles in which\nthe Deathwatch excels, there are a number that form the basis of\nmost operations.\nOne of the simplest, yet arguably the most taxing, duties of\nthe Deathwatch is to stand eternal vigil against the actions of the\nxenos. This is the basis of the system of Watch Fortresses and\nWatch Stations. Each is located in an area where there exists a\nknown threat, or in a strategically significant region through which\nsuch a threat might approach Imperial worlds. An example of the\nformer would be a Watch Station placed on the outer reaches of\na system known to harbour the remains of an ancient xenos race,\nwith its mission being to guard against the enemy’s return. An\nexample of the latter would be a Watch Fortress positioned at the\nconfluence of known warp routes, along which alien invasions are\nknown or are likely to travel.\nInvestigation of potential threats is a vital task of the Deathwatch.\nIndividual Kill-teams are often called upon to perform sweeps of\nareas in which dangerous aliens are suspected of operating. Newly\ndiscovered worlds, visited by Explorators or Rogue Traders may\nbe judged as dangerous, and require a Deathwatch investigation,\nsometimes accompanied by an Inquisitor or other specialists. Such\nmissions can be perilous and the Kill-teams must be well prepared\nto face any threat. They are frequently undertaken far from any\npossibility of reinforcement or rescue should things go awry, so\nthe Battle-Brothers must look to each other for support, and\ncarry with them as much ammunition as possible. Investigation\nmissions can take the Kill-team to a staggering variety of worlds\nand environments, all of which its members must be prepared for.\nThe Battle-Brothers might be expected to cross a burning desert\nof jagged sulphur crystals, or acid swamps infested with alien\npredators.

With such a heart, a warrior can stand\nagainst the terrors of the universe unbowed and unbroken.”\n–Attributed to Ferrus Manus\nWatch Fortress Erioch is a vast space bastion that lies in the\nouter reaches of the Erioch system in the untamed void between\nthe Canis and Acheros salients. It is situated in a stellar dead\nzone populated by only a handful of failing, ancient stars—of\nwhich Erioch itself is one. A brutal mass of armoured basilica,\ndomes, and spires, the Fortress bristles with enough armament\nto rival a sizable battlegroup of warships, largely concealing the\nfact that underneath the Imperial ceramite and firepower, it is\nbuilt on a ruined artefact that was old when Terra’s star was\nfirst forming. Within it is a vast maze of echoing, dust-carpeted\ncorridors that wander past silent chapels and armoured vaults\nsealed with adamantine doors. Beneath war-tattered banners of\nglories past, the Battle-Brothers of the Deathwatch in residence\nmove between cells, practice ranges, armouries and briefing\ntheatres like spectres in a dead city, their numbers swallowed by\nthe vast and labyrinthine nature of the fortress.\nWithin the Watch Fortress, the Deathwatch gathers to rearm,\ntrain, and report. From here, Kill-teams are dispatched on\nmissions to every corner of the Jericho Reach, and sometimes\nbeyond. The Fortress contains vast command cathedrals where\nWatch Captains come to discuss strategy, developments within\ntheir assigned vigils, and consult with the Inquisitor of the\nChamber and Master of Vigilance. Alongside the towering\nAdeptus Astartes scurry the far more numerous servitors and\nhooded, mind-wiped serfs that keep the Fortress alive and\nfunctioning. These lobotomised or oath-bonded servants crew\nthe Watch Fortress’s weaponry, and serve under the eyes of the\nForge Master in the maintenance of its machine spirits, their\npasts shorn from them by mental conditioning. They remember\nnothing of their history, and know no life beyond the fortress\nand the demands of their duty.\nhe Watch Fortress could hold an entire Chapter of Adeptus\nAstartes with ease, but its records show that there are rarely\nmore than a few score Deathwatch garrisoning it at any time.\nEven during the grim events of the Council of the Ascension",

He has heard of Space Marines in\nparables and stories since his childhood, but has never seen\none himself before now. Low ranking, and none too bright,\nHalis has locked himself in a 4’ by 4’ room for the three\ndays, and consequently knows very little of worth about the\nimmediate environs or events.
