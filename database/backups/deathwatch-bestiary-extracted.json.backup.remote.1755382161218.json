Enemies in the Elite Tier come in the form of Chaos Space Marines, Tau Stealth Suits, and Tyranid Warriors. Masters: Hive Tyrants and Daemon Princes are both Master enemies.

Some of the most powerful Master tier enemies are both terrifying foes and cunning commanders. CreaTing an enemy forCe The antagonists in Deathwatch are intended to be used both on their own and in mixed groups. Such a mixed group represents a substantial enemy force that the Deathwatch Battle-Brothers must face and defeat. When creating such an enemy force there are some useful guidelines to bear in mind. Mix a small number of Elites and Masters with Hordes of troops: A Horde is a substantial threat because it takes time to wear down, whereas Elites and Masters have to be focused on in concerted manner to bring them down. Combining them together means the Battle-Brothers have to make tactical choices about how they are going to survive and emerge victorious. A combat capable Master can be faced alone: Some Master tier enemies are so powerful that it can be best to use one as an enemy on his own. If this is part of a larger battle, he might appear from the middle of a fleeing Horde to face the Battle-Brothers alone. 359 X I I I : A d v e r s a r i e s Hordes “Their numbers darkened the land, and blotted out the sun.

Alone, such enemies would stand no chance against the might of the Adeptus Astartes. Together in large groups,\nvered by Dark Apostle Bellephrades Daemon Princes are incredibly powerful entities of the warp, vast and nightmarish beings whose essence is the immortal hell- stuff of the Warp embodied, concentrated, and given form. No two are truly alike, although many maintain a roughly humanoid shape when incarnate in the material realm, their exact forms fashioned from congealed horror and marked with the signs and stigmata of whichever great power they themselves serve. Perhaps the most terrible thing about these walking blasphemies is, if the malefic texts of forbidden Daemonology are to be believed, that once they were mortals. Daemon Princes arose from mortal beings (humans, Traitorous Space Marines, and sometimes even alien creatures) who gave themselves over to the worship of Chaos in life and became its dread champions. These champions of Chaos prospered, slaughtered, and found favour with the fickle Chaos Gods who then transfigured them, refashioning their tainted souls into daemonhood.

Therefore, if the heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to Brother Silas. Modifiers or range and sustained fire apply as normal, but a Horde can never aim.

This is in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that the Horde is armed with. It will also include the Strength Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons. The damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness bonus and armour as normal. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a heretic would do with its axe (1d10+5), and therefore causes 3d10+5 damage if they hit in combat. Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10+2 damage with its ranged attacks. This represents an enemy being mobbed with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking like rain on a single target. creaTing a horde To create a Horde is simply a matter of taking a minion entry from this chapter and replacing its wounds with the Magnitude value of your choosing. examPle Horde This Horde is a large mob of Chaos Heretics.

Perhaps the most terrible thing about these walking blasphemies is, if the malefic texts of forbidden Daemonology are to be believed, that once they were mortals. Daemon Princes arose from mortal beings (humans, Traitorous Space Marines, and sometimes even alien creatures) who gave themselves over to the worship of Chaos in life and became its dread champions. These champions of Chaos prospered, slaughtered, and found favour with the fickle Chaos Gods who then transfigured them, refashioning their tainted souls into daemonhood. T",

Perhaps the most terrible thing about these walking blasphemies is, if the malefic texts of forbidden Daemonology are to be believed, that once they were mortals. Daemon Princes arose from mortal beings (humans, Traitorous Space Marines, and sometimes even alien creatures) who gave themselves over to the worship of Chaos in life and became its dread champions. These champions of Chaos prospered, slaughtered, and found favour with the fickle Chaos Gods who then transfigured them, refashioning their tainted souls into daemonhood. The prize granted for their service and innumerable black deeds—an eternity of darkness in the Warp. daemon Prince Profile Ws Bs s T ag int Per WP fel (18)(12) 75 60 66 45 48 48 48 75 30 Movement: 7/14/21/42 Wounds: 80 Skills: Awareness (Per) +10, Climb (S), Command (Fel) +20, Dodge (Ag) +10, Forbidden Lore (Daemons, Psykers, Warp) (Int) +20, Intimidate (S) +20, Literacy (Int), Scrutiny (Per) +20, Speak Language (Low Gothic, Unholy Tongue) (Int).

The rail gun is particularly potent and its technology is eagerly sought by certain factions within the Adeptus Mechanicus. Anti-grav technology similar to that of the Eldar is widely employed by the Tau in their Hammerhead tanks and Devilfish armoured transports. These technology bases are carried over into non-military applications. Certain items of Tau technology are in the possession of the Imperium, mainly confiscated agricultural and construction equipment seized on frontier worlds from settlers who have traded with Tau merchants. Such technology has been transported back to Mars for further study, where the Adepts of the Machine God hope to penetrate its secrets.

Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10+2 damage with its ranged attacks.

Melee Attacks made by Hordes cannot be Parried or Dodged unless otherwise noted. Ranged: A Horde may make ranged attacks equal to the first digit of its Magnitude. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde can make two ranged attacks. Any additional hits from sustained fire can be applied to any eligible target. Therefore, if the heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to Brother Silas. Modifiers or range and sustained fire apply as normal, but a Horde can never aim. Ammo expenditure and Jamming are never applied to Hordes—they always have enough bullets to keep firing. damage Caused By Hordes Any attack from a Horde that hits has the damage it causes increased by a number of d10s equal to the Horde’s Magnitude divided by ten, with a maximum bonus of +2d10. This is in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that the Horde is armed with. It will also include the Strength Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons. The damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness bonus and armour as normal. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a heretic would do with its axe (1d10+5), and therefore causes 3d10+5 damage if they hit in combat. Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10+2 damage with its ranged attacks. This represents an enemy being mobbed with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking like rain on a single target. creaTing a horde To create a Horde is simply a matter of taking a minion entry from this chapter and replacing its wounds with the Magnitude value of your choosing. examPle Horde This Horde is a large mob of Chaos Heretics.

Melee Attacks made by Hordes cannot be Parried or Dodged unless otherwise noted. Ranged: A Horde may make ranged attacks equal to the first digit of its Magnitude. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde can make two ranged attacks. Any additional hits from sustained fire can be applied to any eligible target. Therefore, if the heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to Brother Silas. Modifiers or range and sustained fire apply as normal, but a Horde can never aim. Ammo expenditure and Jamming are never applied to Hordes—they always have enough bullets to keep firing. damage Caused By Hordes Any attack from a Horde that hits has the damage it causes increased by a number of d10s equal to the Horde’s Magnitude divided by ten, with a maximum bonus of +2d10. This is in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that the Horde is armed with. It will also include the Strength Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons. The damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness bonus and armour as normal. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a heretic would do with its axe (1d10+5), and therefore causes 3d10+5 damage if they hit in combat. Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10+2 damage with its ranged attacks. This represents an enemy being mobbed with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking like rain on a single target. creaTing a horde To create a Horde is simply a matter of taking a minion entry from this chapter and replacing its wounds with the Magnitude value of your choosing. examPle Horde This Horde is a large mob of Chaos Heretics.
