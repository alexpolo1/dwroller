    "title": "The Lion And The Wolf",
    "content": "Over the course of the many battles of the Great Crusade and the subsequent Horus Heresy, Leman\nRuss became firm friends with Lion El’Jonson, primarch of the Dark Angels Legion. The two were at once beloved brothers and bitter rivals, vying all the while for honour and glory. On the world of Dulan, the Space Wolves and the Dark Angels were to assault an enemy-held fortress. Russ claimed the right to lead the attack, for the Tyrant of Dulan had insulted him publicly. But the Lion refused and started the assault early. Russ was furious, and after the battle was won a duel broke out between the brother-primarchs, in which Russ was laid low, only to regain consciousness some time later, after the Dark Angels had departed. To this day, whenever the Space Wolves and the Dark\nAngels serve alongside one another, a ritual duel is fought between the champions of each. Though rarely fatal, the outcome of the fight is regarded as an omen of the battle to come, and much honour is earned by those who continue the brotherly feud of their primarchs.\ns\nSpace Wolves are renowned for their exceptionally sharp senses and their heroism in defence of all Imperial citizens, high or low.\nA Space Wolves Space Marine gains the following benefits: +5 Perception, +5 Fellowship, and the Wolf Senses Solo\nMode Ability (see page 217).\nBonus Talent: Space Wolves characters begin with the Heightened Senses (Smell) Talent.\nRestrictions: Space Wolves characters may not select the Deathwatch Apothecary Speciality.",

Some options and variations are presented as part of the enemy profiles but the possible variety of enemies far exceeds these, and a Games Master should feel free to make adjustments to them as they see fit. If, for example, a game requires a group of Renegade Militia armed with missile launchers they can be created by removing their autoguns, giving them missile launchers and the Heavy Weapon Training (Launcher) Talent.\nenemy Profile PresenTaTion\nIn all the entries presented in this chapter the characteristics, movement values and weapon damages have been presented with all modifications included. For example, a Chaos Space Marine’s Strength includes the +20 increase from his\nAstartes Power Armour, and his Strength Bonus matches this and the effects of the Unnatural Strength Trait. Weapon damages include the effects of the enemy’s Strength Bonus and Talents that always apply to damage such as the Crushing\nBlow talent. Talents, Traits and Special rules that have a variable effect or will only apply in particular circumstances, such as the Hammer Blow Talent, have not been combined into the profiles presented here. It is also important to note that NPCs are not necessarily bound to follow the same strictures for their profiles as player characters.",
