When the\nprimarchs were scattered across the galaxy, Jonson came to Caliban, growing to maturity amongst the beast-\nhaunted forests, not laying eyes upon another human until he was a young adult. Having proved himself to the\nknightly order that defended the peoples of Caliban from the Chaos beasts of the dark forests, Jonson quickly\nrose to power and led a crusade to slay the beasts and deliver the people of Caliban from their evil.\nThe Lion was said to have been temperamental and taciturn, but a brilliant strategist and unstoppable once decided\nupon a course of action. These qualities served him well when he reunited with the Emperor and led the Dark\nAngels Legion in the Great Crusade. One of the great tragedies of the Horus Heresy is that while Jonson earned\nglory amongst the stars, Luther, his closest friend and trusted second in command, turned against him, leading\nthose Space Marines who remained on Caliban to the service of Chaos. Returning to Caliban, Jonson discovered\nhis blood-brother’s treachery. So terrible was his vengeance, so bitter his sense of betrayal, that the ensuing battle\nsaw the destruction of Caliban itself. At the conclusion of the battle, the traitor Luther was captured by the loyal\nDark Angels, but of the Lion, there was no trace.\n"
