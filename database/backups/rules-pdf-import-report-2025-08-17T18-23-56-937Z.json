The\nrich and varied background of\nthe universe and its amazing\ncast of characters appeared to\noffer an unparalleled opportunity for the creation of a really\nenthralling roleplaying experience. As the years passed and\nGW increasingly focussed its publishing efforts on the tabletop\nminiatures game, the prospect of a 40K roleplaying game\nhappening became ever more remote, even if it never lost its\nglittering promise. Some may have even referred to the idea\nas the ‘Holy Grail’ of the roleplaying hobby. Many may have\ndoubted that such a venture would ever come to pass. However,\na few years ago, some folks at Games Workshop finally put\ninto place some plans to do exactly that. The result of their\nefforts was the launch in 2008 of the",

      "title": "Dark heresy book and",
      "content": "the grim darkness of the far future could now be explored by\nlegions of roleplaying enthusiasts. The popularity of Dark\nheresy outstripped all expectations, and it was clear that the\nidea of roleplaying in the 41st Millennium was as strong, if\nnot stronger than it had ever been. The subsequent licensing\nof the property to Fantasy Flight Games first consolidated and\nthen built on this success, in somewhat spectacular fashion it\nhas to be said. FFG have already produced a string of high\nquality supplements for Dark heresy and in 2009 launched\nrogue traDer, the second core rulebook in the series,\nand associated supplements. With this amazing wealth of\nmaterial and the growing popularity of both strands, it is now\ndifficult to imagine a roleplaying scene without a Warhammer\n40,000 presence.\nThis volume, Deathwatch, completes the triptych of 40K\nRoleplay core rulebooks and introduces the Space Marines.\nThat this book is devoted to the Adeptus Astartes explains\nto some extent the structure of the whole 40K roleplay line.\nAs I said earlier, a few years ago a small group of people at\nGames Workshop began to think seriously about how we\nmight actually publish a 40K roleplaying game. There was, if\nI recall, much excitement and quite a few proposals as to how\nwe might approach such a venture. Broadly speaking these\nproposals fell into one of two camps. On the one side was the\nopinion that because Space Marines were so powerful in the\nsetting it made no sense to have them being featured alongside\nother characters at low levels of play and that therefore\nincluding them at all would simply unbalance the game. On\nthe other side was the opinion that a 40K game without\nSpace Marines was just unthinkable and that the game would\nhave little interest if they were left out. So did we publish a\n40K roleplaying game with or without Space Marines? The\nsolution we eventually settled upon was to do both!\nIn fact, we went one further and sketched out a plan that\nadded a third core rulebook to the set. This gave us, on paper\nat least, an interesting progression through the universe of\nthe 41st Millennium and through the power levels of the\nplayer characters. We also gave tentative themes and titles to\nthe three core rulebooks.\nDark heresy would introduce the\nuniverse to roleplayers and provide a very strong environment\nfor developing low level, inexperienced characters under the\naegis of the Inquisition (a format very much inspired by the\nearlier and perfectly successful tabletop game InquIsItor\nby Games Workshop). rogue traDer would expand the\ngame’s horizons and introduce higher level characters and\nadventures and maybe the first look at a playable Space\nMarine. Finally Deathwatch would present the Space Marines\nin all of their glory—the ultimate warriors facing the most\ndangerous challenges.\nAs it turned out, the GW team only got to do part one of\nthe set and that book along with the plan we had sketched\nout was offered to FFG when they acquired the license. To\nour delight, they liked both\nDark heresy and our plan and\nimmediately set about turning parts two and three into a reality.\nIn the course of doing this it has been inevitable that Ross\nand his teams have had to adapt those initial ideas somewhat.\nAs well as making some essential changes and developments\nthey have added an enormous amount of original material of\ntheir own devising to the final fleshed-out products. This has\nresulted in the most amazing series of roleplaying books, as\nyou can no doubt ascertain for yourself by examining the book\nin your hands right now. This realisation of those early ideas\nin such a high quality fashion and the dedication and ongoing\ncommitment of FFG to the property is immensely satisfying to\nthose of us at GW who were involved in those early planning\nmeetings. It is good to know that the ‘Holy Grail’ has not\nonly been grasped but that it is in such talented hands. The\n41st Millennium may be grim and dark but the future of 40K\nroleplaying looks very bright indeed.\nAlan Merrett,\nGames Workshop 2010",

The\nPrimarchs wielded powers the like of which are not known\nin the universe today. The first Space Marines of the nascent\nImperium were also the creation of that period, each made using\nthe genetic inheritance of one of the Primarchs, albeit diluted a\nhundred times for no human body could contain such power.\nEach Primarch led a Legion of Space Marines, each a formation\nconsiderably larger than the later Space Marine Chapters.\nThe names of many of the Primarchs echo down the\nmillennia, and the tales of their deeds are legendary. Names\nsuch as Lion El’Jonson, Leman Russ, Rogal Dorn, and the angelMankind dwells. They command a reverence second only to\nthat afforded the Emperor himself. Other names are cursed\nwherever men gather, for many Primarchs rebelled against the\nEmperor and followed Horus, mightiest of their number, when\nhe raised his standard against Mankind.\nAt the very height of the Emperor’s Great Crusade, Horus\nled his Traitor Legions against those who stood loyal at the\nEmperor’s side. Worlds burned in the name of the Dark Gods,\nand a terror unlike any seen before was unleashed.

The forces of darkness pressed in around\nthe guttering flame of humanity, but desperate times called\nfor desperate solutions. Sanguinius of the Blood Angels and\nRogal Dorn of the Imperial Fists, together with their bravest\nwarriors, would accompany the Emperor and take the fight to\nHorus upon his battle-barge, a mighty warship in orbit above\nTerra. The Emperor and his warriors teleported onto Horus’\nbattle-barge but found themselves separated and scattered\nthroughout the corrupt vessel by means of dark sorcery. The\nEmperor fought his way to the Warmaster but was too late to\nsave Sanguinius, who Horus slew when the angelic Primarch\nrefused to turn to Chaos. Yet, some maintain that Sanguinius\ninflicted a wound, however small, upon his erstwhile brother.\nHorus and the Emperor clashed in a battle of both flesh and\nspirit. Horus was filled with the power of the Dark Gods and\ndealt the Emperor a mortal blow, but in the end, the Emperor’s\nwill was the greater, and Horus was struck down with the last\nounce of the Emperor’s strength. The traitor was destroyed\nutterly and, with his death, the power of the Traitor Legions\nwas broken. When Dorn and his warriors finally fought\ntheir way into the rebel warmaster’s sanctum, they found the\nEmperor’s broken and ruined body, and it is said that their\ncries of woe were heard far below on Terra itself.\nRogal Dorn, most determined and unbending of the\nPrimarchs, bore his master’s body back to Terra and, under\nthe direction of the crippled Emperor, bound him within the\nGolden Throne to sustain his existence for all eternity with\nconstant sacrifice and baroque machineries. The followers of\nthe Ruinous Powers were defeated, but it was victory won at a\nterrible cost. The brotherhood of the Primarchs was sundered,\nand the Emperor’s vision for the Imperium and all of Mankind\nlay in ruins—the last, best hope of its fulfilment lost forever.\nThe galactic empire he had forged was all but destroyed, and\nit was to take many more years of brutal warfare before all the\nTraitor forces were defeated and driven into the hellish chaos\nof the Eye of Terror. The toll numbered in the billions, and\nuncounted worlds had been left as little more than corpsewas finally extinguished, though Mankind still teetered on the\nvery brink of extinction.\nThe Horus Heresy had revealed weaknesses in the genebeen exacerbated by the need to keep the huge formations\nup to strength in the terrible wars being fought at the time.\nThe insidious powers of Chaos had been able to manipulate\nthis corruption to turn Horus and many of the Space Marines\nunder his command against the Emperor. Once Horus was\ndefeated, it was decided that the forces of the Imperium\nwould be reorganised so that a similar catastrophe could not\nbe repeated.\nThe Space Marine Legions were divided up to create\none Chapter of the same name as the founding Legion and\na number of new Chapters with new names. This event was\ncalled the Second Founding, and over two dozen further\nFoundings have occurred in the ten millennia since. It is\nnot known exactly how many Chapters were created in the\naftermath of the Horus Heresy, as many of the Imperium’s\nrecords are incomplete or lost entirely, and whole Chapters\nhave been created and destroyed in the millennia that have\nfollowed. What is known is that there are just over a thousand\nChapters scattered across the Imperium, each a brotherhood\nof the very finest warriors Humanity can muster.",

The first High\nLords of Terra established the structure by which the Adeptus\nTerra operated, and described the feudal responsibilities and\nduties of the planetary lords. One of the most important\naccomplishments was the reorganisation of the Imperium’s\nfighting forces. This was undertaken almost single-handedly by\nthe Primarch of the Ultramarines Legion, Roboute Guilliman,\nwho with characteristic speed and efficiency codified the\nstructure of the Imperial Guard, the Imperial Navy, and\nthe Space Marines. Of all of his works, the most influential\nis the Codex Astartes, the great prescriptive tome that lays\ndown the basic organisational and tactical rules for the Space\nMarine Chapters.\nThe Codex Astartes decreed that Space Marines would\nbe created and trained over a controlled period of time.\nThe genetic banks used to cultivate the implants that turn a\nnormal man into a mighty Space Marine would be carefully\nmonitored, and cultivated organs would be subject to the most\nstringent tests of purity. Young initiates would undergo rigorous\ntrials of physical and psychological suitability before they\nwere accepted, and only those of the highest calibre would\nbe chosen.\nOn Earth, the Adeptus Terra created genetic repositories\nto produce and store Space Marine gene-seed. These banks\nwere used to provide all new gene-seed for Space Marines\nand, to prevent cross-contamination, the genetic material of\neach of the old Legions was isolated. Henceforth, the new\nSpace Marine Chapters would receive gene-seed only from\ntheir own genetic stock.\nThe gene-seed of the Traitor Legions was placed under a\ntime-locked stasis seal, although at the time, many believed\nthese dangerous stocks should be destroyed. By taking direct\ncontrol of the genetic stocks, the Adepts of Terra could\nultimately control the Space Marines. Now they alone had the\npower to destroy or create Space Marine chapters at will.",

Because most Chapters have\nexisted for many thousands of years, a number of these\nChapters have gene-seed that has mutated over time. This\nhas resulted in changes in the exact nature of the artificially\ncultured organs. Such changes may sometimes make an\nimplant useless—such is the case with the Imperial Fists, who\nare known to lack the organ called the Betcher’s gland, which\nallows a Space Marine to spit corrosive poison. In other cases,\nthe changes in an organ might reduce its effectiveness or cause\nstrange new effects—the Salamanders, for example, share\nskin as dark as coal, due to the actions of their melanchromic\norgan. Whatever the result, it will affect the entire Chapter,\nas all Space Marines belonging to the Chapter share implants\ncultured from the original gene-seed.\nAlthough a Chapter’s Apothecaries and surgeons are able\nto perform the necessary implant operations, they do not\nnecessarily understand the exact functioning of each organ.\nThe processes involved are incredibly ancient. Procedures\nare handed down from generation to generation, becoming\nincreasingly ritualised and misinterpreted. For these reasons,\nthe efficiency of each organ differs from Chapter to Chapter,\ndepending on the condition of the Chapter’s gene-seed and\nthe degree of debasement of its surgical procedures. In some\nChapters, mutation of gene-seed, poor surgical procedure,\nor inadequate post-operative conditioning has twisted the\nfunctioning of implants.\nIn addition to the problem of mutated implants, many\nChapters have simply lost one or more types of gene-seed\norgans due to accident, genetic failure, or some other cause.\nVery few Chapters, therefore, possess all nineteen of the\nimplants.

The newly implanted\norgans must be monitored very carefully, imbalances corrected,\nand any sign of corrupt development treated. This chemical\ntreatment is reduced after completion of the initiation process,\nbut it never ends. Space Marines undergo periodic treatment for\nthe rest of their lives in order to maintain a stable metabolism.\nTo this end, power armour contains extensive monitoring and\ndrug dispensation equipment.\nAs the super-enhanced body grows, the recipient must learn\nhow to use his new skills. Some of the implants, specifically\nthe Catalespean Node and Occulobe, can only function once\ncorrect hypnotherapy has been administered. Hypnotherapy\nis not always as effective as chemical treatment, but it can\nhave substantial results. If a Space Marine can be taught how\nto control his own metabolism, his dependence on drugs is\nlessened. The process is undertaken in a machine called a\nhypnomat. Space Marines are placed in a state of hypnosis and\nsubjected to visual and aural images in order to awaken their\nminds to their unconscious metabolic processes.\nA Space Marine is more than a human with extraordinary\npowers.

A Space Marine can also\nthink and react at lightning speeds. Memory training is an\nimportant part of the indoctrination as well. Some Space\nMarines develop photographic memories. Space Marines vary\nin intelligence as do other men, and their individual mental\nabilities vary in degree.\nThe very first stage in the process is the implantation of\nthe Secondary\bHeart, normally between the age of ten\nand fourteen.

This implant enables Space\nMarines to survive low oxygen concentrations and traumatic\ninjury, and is also necessary in the maintenance of the subject’s\nmetabolism, which will be pushed to its limits as his body is\nsubject to the many surgical procedures it will endure over the\nnext several years.\nThe next stage in the implantation process is the addition\nof the Ossmodula. This is a tube-shaped organ whose small\nsize belies its complex structure. The Ossmodula monitors and\nsecretes hormones affecting epiphiseal fusion and ossification\nof the skeleton. At the same time, the specially engineered\nhormones encourage the forming bones to absorb ceramicyears following implantation, this will have caused considerable\nstrengthening of the long bones, extreme ossification of the\nchest cavity (caused by growth of the ribs forming a solid mass\nof inter-laced bone plates), and a general increase in the size of\nthe recipient’s skeleton.\nNormally implanted at the same time as the Ossmodula,\nthe Biscopea is emplaced within the chest cavity. It is small,\napproximately spherical and, like the Ossmodula, its primary\nfunction is hormonal. The presence of the Biscopea stimulates\nmuscle growth throughout the body. These muscles bond to\nthe rapidly growing skeleton, which is why these two implants\nare often undergone at the same time.\nPhases four and five are often implanted at the same time,\nbetween the ages of twelve and fourteen. The Haemastamen\nis a tiny organ, placed within a main blood vessel and serves\ntwo main purposes. Firstly, it monitors and to some degree\ncontrols the Ossmodula and the Biscopea. It also alters the\nconstituent make-up of the recipient’s blood. As a result, the\nSpace Marine’s blood will be considerably more efficient than\nordinary human blood, as it has to be considering the extra\nbiological hardware the Space Marine carries inside him.\nThe second implant emplaced at this time is the Larraman’s\b\nOrgan. This is a liver-shaped, dark, fleshy organ. It is implanted\ninto the chest cavity along with a complicated array of blood\nvessels. The organ generates and stores special Larraman cells.\nIf the recipient is wounded, these cells are released into the\nbloodstream, where they latch onto leucocytes in the blood\nand are transported to the site of the wound. Once outside\nthe body, the Larraman cells form a skin substitute of instant\nscar tissue, staunching the flow of blood and protecting any\nexposed wound area. This process is almost instantaneous, and\nit can appear to the onlooker as if the blood is frozen solid\neven before it hits the ground.\nWith the initiation of phase six, the subject is ready to begin\nthe extensive hypnotherapy that will continue throughout\nthe entire initiation process, and beyond. The Catalepsean\b\nNode is a brain implant usually inserted into the back of the\nskull via a hole drilled into the occipital bone. The pea-sized\norgan influences the circadian rhythms of sleep and the body’s\nresponse to sleep deprivation. Normally, a Space Marine sleeps\nlike any normal man, but if deprived of it, the Catalepsean\nNode becomes active. The recipient is capable of sleeping\nand remaining awake at the same time by switching off areas\nof the brain sequentially. This process cannot replace normal\nsleep entirely, but it increases a Space Marine’s survivability by\nallowing awareness of the environment whilst resting.\nThe next three phases of the process, the implantation\nof the Preomnor, Omophagea and Multi-lung are often\nundertaken at the same time, between the ages of fourteen\nand sixteen. The Preomnor is a large implant which fits into\nthe chest cavity. It is a pre-digestive stomach which allows\nthe recipient to eat a variety of otherwise poisonous or\nindigestible materials. No actual digestion tales place in the\nPreomnor. Instead, individual sensory tubes assess potential\npoisons and neutralise them or, where necessary, isolate the\nPreomnor from the rest of the digestive tract. The Omophagea\nis a complicated implant that is placed within the spinal cord\nbetween the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, where it becomes\nin effect part of the brain. Four nerve sheaths called neuroclea\nare implanted between the spine and the preomnoral stomach\nwall. The Omophagea is designed to absorb genetic material\ngenerated in animal tissue as a function of memory. This\nendows the Space Marine with an unusual survival trait—he\ncan actually learn by eating. If a Space Marine eats part of a\ncreature, he will absorb some of the memories of that creature.\nThis can be very useful in an alien environment. Incidentally, it\nis the presence of this organ which has created the various flesh\neating and blood drinking rituals for which many Chapters are\nknown, as well as giving the names to Chapters such as the\nBlood Drinkers and Flesh Tearers. The third organ implanted\nat this time is the Multi-lung. This large, tubular, grey organ\nis sometimes called the ‘third lung’. Blood is pumped through\nthe organ via connecting vessels grafted onto the recipient’s\npulmonary system. Atmosphere is taken in by means of a\nsphincter located in the trachea. In toxic atmospheres, an\nassociated sphincter muscle closes the trachea and restricts\nnormal breathing, thus protecting the lungs. The Multi-lung is\nable to absorb oxygen from poorly oxygenated or poisonous\nair without suffering damage thanks to its own efficient toxin\ndispersal, neutralisation, and regeneration systems.\nPhase ten of the process is the implantation of the\nOcculobe. This small slug-like organ sits at the base of the\nbrain. It provides the hormonal and genetic stimuli which\nenable a Space Marine’s eyes to respond to optic-therapy. The\nOcculobe does not in itself improve a Space Marine’s eyesight,\nbut it allows technicians to make adjustments to the growth\npatterns of the eye and the light-receptive retinal cells. A Space\nMarine has far better eyesight than a normal human, and can\nsee in low light conditions almost as well as in daylight.\nPhase eleven is the addition of the Lyman’s\bEar. This\norgan enables a Space Marine to consciously enhance and\neven filter certain types of background noise. Not only is\nhearing improved, but a Space Marine cannot become dizzy\nor nauseous as a result of extreme disorientation. A Lyman’s\nEar is externally indistinguishable from a normal human ear.\nBetween the ages of fifteen and sixteen, phase twelve is\ninitiated, in which a flat, circular organ called the Sus-an\b\nMembrane is implanted over the top of the exposed brain.\nIt then grows into the brain tissue until completely merged.\nThe organ is not effective until subsequent chemical therapy\nand training is applied. However, a properly tutored Space\nMarine may then enter into a state of suspended animation.\nThis may be a conscious action, or may happen automatically\nin the event of extreme physical trauma. In this condition,\na Space Marine may survive for many years, even if bearing",

      "content": "otherwise fatal injuries. Only appropriate chemical therapy\nand auto-suggestion can revive a Space Marine from this\nstate—he cannot revive himself. The longest known period of\ndeanimation followed by successful reanimation is 567 years,\nin the case of Brother Silas Err of the Dark Angels Chapter.\nThe next phase of the process is the implantation of the\nMelanchromic\bOrgan. This hemispherical, black organ\nfunctions in an indirect and extremely complex manner. It\nmonitors radiation levels and types bombarding the skin,\nand if necessary, sets off chemical reactions to darken the\nskin and protect it from ultraviolet exposure. It also provides\nlimited protection from other forms of radiation. Differing\nMelanchromic Organ gene-seed from Chapter to Chapter leads\nto variations in skin and hair colour, and in some Chapters all\nof the Space Marines may have identical colouration, such as is\nfound in the albino warriors of the Death Spectres Chapter.\nPhases fourteen and fifteen, the implantation of the Oolitic\b\nKidney and the Neuroglottis, are often undertaken at the\nsame time. The Oolitic Kidney is red-brown and heart-shaped\nand improves and modifies the Space Marine’s circulatory\nsystem, enabling other implants to function effectively. The\nOolitic Kidney also filters blood extremely efficiently and\nquickly. The Secondary Heart and Oolitic Kidney are able to\nact together, performing an emergency detoxification function\nin which the Space Marine is rendered unconscious as his\nblood is circulated at high speed. This enables a Space Marine\nto survive poisons and gases which are otherwise too much\nfor even the multi-lung to cope with. The Neuroglottis enables\nthe Space Marine to assess a potential food by taste. The organ\nis implanted in the back of the mouth. By chewing, or simply\nby tasting, a Space Marine can detect a wide variety of natural\npoisons, some chemicals and even the distinctive odours of\nsome creatures. To some degree, a Space Marine is also able to\ntrack a target by taste alone.\nIn phase sixteen, normally at age sixteen, a small organ\ncalled the Mucranoid is implanted in the lower intestine\nwhere its hormonal secretions are absorbed by the colon.\nThese secretions initiate a modification of the sweat glands.\nThis modification normally makes no difference to the Space\nMarine until activated by appropriate chemical therapy. As\na result of this treatment, the Space Marine sweats an oily,\nnaturally cleansing substance which coats the skin. This\nprotects the Space Marine against extremes of temperature\nand even offers a slight degree of protection against vacuum.\nMucranoid chemical therapy is standard procedure in long\nspace voyages and when fighting in vacuum or near-vacuum.\nPhase seventeen is the implantation of two identical organs\ncalled Betcher’s\bGlands. These are placed into the lower\nlip, alongside the salivary glands or into the hard palette. The\nBetcher’s Gland works in a similar way to the poison gland of\nvenomous reptiles by synthesising and storing deadly poison.\nSpace Marines are rendered immune to this poison by virtue\nof the gland’s presence. The gland allows the Space Marine to\nspit a blinding contact poison, which is also highly corrosive.\nA Space Marine imprisoned behind iron bars could easily\nchew his way out given a few hours.\nIn the penultimate phase of the process, a pair of glands\ncalled Progenoids are implanted, one in the neck and the\nother deep in the chest cavity. This takes place between the age\nof sixteen and eighteen. These glands are vitally important to\nthe very survival of the Space Marine’s Chapter. Each organ\ngrows within the Space Marine, absorbing hormonal stimuli\nand genetic material from the other implants. After five years,\nthe neck gland is mature and ready for removal. After ten\nyears, the chest gland becomes mature and is also ready to\nbe removed. A gland may be removed any time after it has\nmatured, and it represents the Chapter’s only source of genecorresponding to each zygote implanted into the recipient.\nOnce removed by surgery, the Progenoid must be carefully\nprepared, its individual gene-seeds checked for mutation, and\nsound gene-seeds stored. Gene-seeds can be stored indefinitely\nunder suitable conditions.\nSpace Marine Apothecaries carry a special device known\nas a reductor, which they can use in battlefield conditions to\nremove the Progenoid glands of a fallen Space Marine, so\nthat, even should he die before his glands are harvested, they\nmay be recovered. The whole purpose of the Progenoid is to\nprovide gene-seed to enable the Chapter to continue. It is not\npossible to create a zygote in any other way. Each Chapter’s\nstock of gene-seed is therefore unique to itself. Gene-seed has\na great deal of religious significance to a Chapter, representing\nits identity and future. Without gene-seed, a Chapter has no\nfuture. The extinction of a type of gene-seed means that a\nzygote has been lost forever. The extinction of the Progenoid\ngene-seed itself would effectively mean the end to a Chapter.\nAs each Space Marine has only two Progenoid glands,\nthe rate at which a Chapter can create new Space Marines\nis restricted. It may take many years for a Chapter to rebuild\nitself after heavy losses. Gene-seed is often rendered useless if\na Space Marine is exposed to high radiation levels or other\nforms of genetic disturbance. The efficiency of different\nChapters’ Progenoid gene-seed also varies, so some Chapters\nare able to make up their numbers faster than others.\nThe final and the most distinctive implant is the Black\b\nCarapace, which cannot be implanted beyond the age of\neighteen. This looks like a film of black plastic when growing\nin the tanks. This is removed from its culture-solution and cut\ninto sheets, which are implanted directly beneath the skin of\nthe recipient’s torso. Within a few hours, the tissue expands,\nhardens on the outside, and sends invasive neural bundles\ndeep inside the subject. After several months, the recipient is\nfitted with neural sensors and transfusion points, cut into the\nhardened carapace. These artificial interface points mesh with\nfeatures integral to the power armour, such as the monitoring,\nmedicinal, and maintenance units. Without the benefit of the\nBlack Carapace, a Space Marine’s power armour would be far\nless effective.",

Scout squads consist of a Space Marine\nSergeant and four to nine Scouts. The role of the Sergeant\nis to train the Scouts and lead them in battle. Only Sergeants\nof considerable experience and status are designated for this\nrole. Scouts attend to every word their Sergeant utters, for it is\nsaid that he has forgotten more of war than many more senior\nofficers will ever learn.\nWhilst serving as a Scout, a Neophyte learns the most\nsubtle arts of war. In a range of infiltration and reconnaissance\nmissions, he learns how to approach and observe the enemy.\nInformation gathered in such missions is passed back to the\nmain battle force. The Scouts get their first taste of combat\nby way of carefully placed ambushes, the Scout Sergeant\ndrawing on centuries of experience to deploy his charges in\nsuch a manner as to teach them as valuable a lesson as the\nenemy. Unlike that enemy, the Scouts learn valuable skills in\nsuch combats—the enemy earns nothing more than a quick\ndeath, for even a Neophyte Space Marine is a puissant warrior\ncompared to a mortal man.\nA Space Marine serving in a Devastator squad may only\nrecently have completed his service in the Tenth Company\nand been initiated as a Space Marine. It will be his first\nexperience of fighting in power armour. When first assigned\nto such a squad, the Space Marine will bear a bolter and\ngrenades and fulfil a support role within the squad, providing\nclose support to those Battle-Brothers armed with heavy\nweapons, identifying targets and being close at hand to\nproffer ammunition and to take up the weapons of any who\nshould fall. Only when he has proven himself steady and\nreliable in battle will the Space Marine be entrusted with one\nof the Chapter’s mighty heavy weapons, which he will come\nto master over the course of several hundred battles.\nDevastator squads consist of a Sergeant and nine Space\nMarines. Up to four Space Marines may be armed with heavy\nweapons, whilst the remainder will carry bolters. This is\nthe most heavily armed type of Space Marine squad of all,\nand they are deployed wherever overwhelming firepower is\nneeded, especially when the Chapter faces enemy tanks or\nfortified positions.\nHaving proved himself steadfast and disciplined in the\nDevastator squads, a Space Marine will in time earn himself\na place in an Assault squad. Here the Space Marine comes\nto master the application of overwhelming force, taking the\nfight directly to the enemy’s strong points. He embraces the\ncontrolled savagery of close combat and looks his enemy in\nthe eye as he deals him death. Assault squads are specialists\nat fighting in hand-to-hand combat. Each squad consists\nof a Sergeant and nine Space Marines all equipped with\njump packs and armed with a close combat weapon in each\nhand. Common armament consists of a bolt pistol and a",

      "content": "chainsword. Optionally, two of the Space Marines may carry\nplasma pistols. This combination is ideal for fast-attacking,\nclose-quarter fighting assault troops.\nEven though Tactical squads are the most common type\nin any Chapter, to earn a place in one a Space Marine must\nhave proven himself both courageous and wise in battle.\nThroughout his service in the Devastator and Assault squads,\nhe will be proven adaptable in his approach to the arts of war\nand will have mastered a range of tactics and weaponry.\nTactical squads are the most commonly fielded squad\ntypes in a Chapter. A Tactical squad is led by a Sergeant and\nincludes nine other Space Marines. Of these, seven Battlecan be armed with bolters or, alternatively, one may carry a\nheavy weapon such as a missile launcher or a heavy bolter,\nand the other may carry a special weapon such as a flamer or\nmeltagun. This combination is the most tactically flexible and\noffers a good mixture of capabilities within the squad.\nAfter serving in hundreds of campaigns and thousands of\nbattles, and having conquered the very worst the galaxy has\nto throw at him, a Space Marine is likely to be considered a\nVeteran. In most Chapters, such an honour is not measured\nby length of service, but in blood spilled, horrors overcome,\nand mighty deeds done. As a prelude to service in the First\n(Veteran) Company, many Space Marine Veterans fulfill the\nrole of Sergeant, leading squads of all types in any of the\nother companies. Thus, many of the Space Marines of the\nVeteran company will be battle-proven leaders as well as\nhighly experienced warriors.\nThe warriors of the Veteran company are fielded in one of\nthree squad types:\nTerminator squads wear the uniquely powerful Terminator\narmour, sometimes called tactical dreadnought armour. This\narmoured suit is massive in construction, virtually turning a\nSpace Marine into a one-man tank. Every Chapter has a limited\nnumber of Terminator armour suits, and each is an ancient\nartefact crafted many thousands of years ago. Terminators are\nless mobile than other Space Marines and are primarily used\nin boarding actions or in extreme close quarters when heavy\nfire support cannot be easily brought to bear. So resilient is\nthe armour that it is reputedly able to operate inside plasma\nreactors, within volcanoes, and inside highly irradiated areas\nof deep space. Legend has it that the armour can even survive\nthe tread of a Titan. To wear an ancient suit of Terminator\narmour is one of the greatest honours to which a Space\nMarine can aspire. Each suit bears on its left shoulder the Crux\nTerminatus, the unique badge of the Terminator. Each Crux is\nsaid to contain at its core a tiny fragment of the armour worn\nby the Emperor himself when he fought his final battle against\nthe traitor Warmaster Horus, providing a direct link between\nthe Space Marine and the Father of Mankind.\nDespite its obvious benefits, Terminator armour is not\nsuitable for all missions. Most of the time, Veterans take to the\nfield wearing ordinary power armour, albeit a suit inscribed\nwith many hundreds of battle honours. When wearing power\narmour, Veterans are formed into vanguard Veteran squads or\nsternguard Veteran squads. By dint of their rank, Veterans have\naccess to the most fearsome weaponry in the Chapter’s arsenal,\nincluding sacred blades and artificer-crafted combi-weapons\nof uniquely masterful craftsmanship. Vanguard Veteran\nsquads go to battle equipped with the most lethal of close\ncombat weapons, and often wear jump packs to bring them\nto bear before the enemy can even react. Sternguard Veteran\nsquads carry a wide array of ranged weaponry and specialised\nammunition, and are masters in its overwhelming application.\nVeteran squads are rarely deployed en masse, but are instead\nused to bolster the line, provide an unstoppable speartip or to\nact as a highly flexible and mobile reserve.\nMASTERS OF THE cHAPTER\nEach of the Chapter’s ten companies is led by a Captain.\nThese leaders are second in experience only to the Chapter\nMaster himself, and each is a warrior so deadly that he will\nrarely meet his match. Each Captain is an inspirational and\ndetermined leader, able to coordinate the Space Marines under\nhis command whatever the opposition. In addition to leading\nSpace Marines in battle, each Captain holds titles dependent\non his other responsibilities with regard to the workings of\nthe Chapter or its home world, such as Master of the Fleet or\nMaster of the Marches.\nOf the thousand awesome and terrifying warriors that\ncomprise a Space Marine Chapter, there is but one Chapter\nMaster, a leader with centuries of experience in the very\ncrucible of battle. His own fighting skills will be unsurpassed,\nwhether in the use of gun, blade, or bare hands. His very\nrank speaks of a past littered with the bodies of bloodied,\nbeaten foes of the most terrifying and inhuman sort. It is not\nenough, however, for the Chapter Master to be its foremost\nwarrior. He must also be a superb tactician, grounded in the\nteachings of the Codex Astartes and honed through countless\ndecisions made in the maelstrom of close action. His soldiers\nare also his brothers, and he knows that they will give their\nlives at his command. He must preserve these magnificent\nfighters, but must also accomplish his mission and uphold the\nhonour of his Chapter. He will be steeped in the lore of his\nChapter and be sworn to keep its secrets and must conduct\nhis diplomacy accordingly, for Space Marines maintain a web\nof time-proven oaths and honours debts and do not simply\nheed the commands of Imperial functionaries. Those who\nwish a Chapter Master to send his warriors into battle must\ngive him good reason to do so. In addition to this, a Chapter\nMaster will often be the ruler of his Chapter’s home world, a\nresource that is too valuable for him to ignore. Amongst the\ngreatest risks facing a Chapter Master is the very power he\nwields, for a Chapter of Space Marines is a force capable of\ndevastating entire worlds at his order.\nEven a Space Marine can feel pride, ferocity, and desire—\nit is, after all, their hero’s soul that drives them to acts of\nselfless sacrifice. But in these things lie the seeds of hubris\nthat can eventually lead to damnation. Any Space Marine, but\nespecially a Chapter Master, must beware the short path to\nvictory, must consider both the ends and the means, and must\nheed the example of Emperor and Primarch.",
