The forces of darkness pressed in around\nthe guttering flame of humanity, but desperate times called\nfor desperate solutions. Sanguinius of the Blood Angels and\nRogal Dorn of the Imperial Fists, together with their bravest\nwarriors, would accompany the Emperor and take the fight to\nHorus upon his battle-barge, a mighty warship in orbit above\nTerra. The Emperor and his warriors teleported onto Horus’\nbattle-barge but found themselves separated and scattered\nthroughout the corrupt vessel by means of dark sorcery. The\nEmperor fought his way to the Warmaster but was too late to\nsave Sanguinius, who Horus slew when the angelic Primarch\nrefused to turn to Chaos. Yet, some maintain that Sanguinius\ninflicted a wound, however small, upon his erstwhile brother.\nHorus and the Emperor clashed in a battle of both flesh and\nspirit. Horus was filled with the power of the Dark Gods and\ndealt the Emperor a mortal blow, but in the end, the Emperor’s\nwill was the greater, and Horus was struck down with the last\nounce of the Emperor’s strength. The traitor was destroyed\nutterly and, with his death, the power of the Traitor Legions\nwas broken. When Dorn and his warriors finally fought\ntheir way into the rebel warmaster’s sanctum, they found the\nEmperor’s broken and ruined body, and it is said that their\ncries of woe were heard far below on Terra itself.\nRogal Dorn, most determined and unbending of the\nPrimarchs, bore his master’s body back to Terra and, under\nthe direction of the crippled Emperor, bound him within the\nGolden Throne to sustain his existence for all eternity with\nconstant sacrifice and baroque machineries. The followers of\nthe Ruinous Powers were defeated, but it was victory won at a\nterrible cost. The brotherhood of the Primarchs was sundered,\nand the Emperor’s vision for the Imperium and all of Mankind\nlay in ruins—the last, best hope of its fulfilment lost forever.\nThe galactic empire he had forged was all but destroyed, and\nit was to take many more years of brutal warfare before all the\nTraitor forces were defeated and driven into the hellish chaos\nof the Eye of Terror. The toll numbered in the billions, and\nuncounted worlds had been left as little more than corpsehaunted wastelands as the raging inferno of the Horus Heresy\nwas finally extinguished, though Mankind still teetered on the\nvery brink of extinction.\nThe Horus Heresy had revealed weaknesses in the geneseed of several of the early Space Marine Legions, which had\nbeen exacerbated by the need to keep the huge formations\nup to strength in the terrible wars being fought at the time.\nThe insidious powers of Chaos had been able to manipulate\nthis corruption to turn Horus and many of the Space Marines\nunder his command against the Emperor. Once Horus was\ndefeated, it was decided that the forces of the Imperium\nwould be reorganised so that a similar catastrophe could not\nbe repeated.\nThe Space Marine Legions were divided up to create\none Chapter of the same name as the founding Legion and\na number of new Chapters with new names. This event was\ncalled the Second Founding, and over two dozen further\nFoundings have occurred in the ten millennia since. It is\nnot known exactly how many Chapters were created in the\naftermath of the Horus Heresy, as many of the Imperium’s\nrecords are incomplete or lost entirely, and whole Chapters\nhave been created and destroyed in the millennia that have\nfollowed. What is known is that there are just over a thousand\nChapters scattered across the Imperium, each a brotherhood\nof the very finest warriors Humanity can muster.",

The Chapter’s officers might visit the\nculture once a generation and will be the subject of myth and\nlegend. These mighty warriors from beyond the stars are figures\nof awe, and their word is law.\nThe nature of the trials set by the outsiders vary enormously,\nbut all are so arduous that only a handful pass them. Those\nwho fail may be lucky to even survive, for many trials take\nthe form of ritual combat, the hunting of a great beast, or the\nperformance of incredibly dangerous feats of strength and\nbravery. At the conclusion of the trials, those few aspirants that\nhave been deemed worthy are taken away, invariably never to\nsee their people again.\nIt is always a great honour for a family to have a son chosen\nby the Space Marines, even for societies with little conception\nof the greater galaxy beyond their world. The Space Wolves are\nan example of this. The Wolf Priests of the Space Wolves scour\nthe warring tribes of their home world Fenris for their strongest\nand bravest youths, while Ultramarines traditionally draw their\ncandidates from the elite training barracks of a whole group of\nplanetary systems known collectively as Ultramar, the realm of\nthe Ultramarines.\nOther Chapters have no single home world and travel the\ngalaxy in gigantic fleets of battleships, recruiting either from a\nregular series of worlds or from the war zones to which they are\nassigned. The Black Templars are one such example of a fleetbased Chapter, as are the Dark Angels.\nOnce accepted, the young aspirants become Neophytes and\nbegin their regimen of training and biological enhancement.\nEach Chapter has its own traditions regarding the initiation of\nthe recruit into its legends and secrets. This process often runs\nparallel to the bio-genetic treatments the Neophyte must undergo.\nAs the physical transformation proceeds, spiritual change also\noccurs. Both are tempered by ongoing experience on the field of\nbattle and the rituals in which the Neophyte must participate.\nThe nature of such rites varies enormously from one Chapter\nto the next. Some are solemn affairs recalling the sacrifice the\nEmperor made for humanity. Others are raucous celebrations\ndrawing on the culture and nature of the Chapter’s home world.\nStill more are bloody and barbaric involving ritual bloodletting,\nscarification, or amputation. All are vital to the arcane workings\nof the Chapter, and his participation is a prerequisite of the\nNeophyte’s acceptance by his would-be brothers-in-arms.\nSuch are the rigours of the training that many do not survive.\nWhether he is crippled upon the battlefield, or found spiritually\nwanting during a particularly exacting ritual, a Neophyte may\nfind himself cast out, his future with the Chapter curtailed.\nIn some instances, the Neophyte may transgress one of\nthe many articles of Chapter law, and injury at war may prove\npreferable to the punishment. Many possible fates await those\nwho fall by the wayside in this manner. Most are mind-scrubbed\nand become Chapter serfs—manservants and menials. The less\nfortunate are transformed into living servitors—mindless biomechanical automatons who exist only to assist the Chapter’s\nTechmarines in the operation of heavy and frequently dangerous\nmachinery.

      "content": "gene-Seed\nThere are nineteen varieties of gene-seed corresponding to\nthe nineteen different superhuman organs that are surgically\nimplanted into a Space Marine. Because most Chapters have\nexisted for many thousands of years, a number of these\nChapters have gene-seed that has mutated over time. This\nhas resulted in changes in the exact nature of the artificially\ncultured organs. Such changes may sometimes make an\nimplant useless—such is the case with the Imperial Fists, who\nare known to lack the organ called the Betcher’s gland, which\nallows a Space Marine to spit corrosive poison. In other cases,\nthe changes in an organ might reduce its effectiveness or cause\nstrange new effects—the Salamanders, for example, share\nskin as dark as coal, due to the actions of their melanchromic\norgan. Whatever the result, it will affect the entire Chapter,\nas all Space Marines belonging to the Chapter share implants\ncultured from the original gene-seed.\nAlthough a Chapter’s Apothecaries and surgeons are able\nto perform the necessary implant operations, they do not\nnecessarily understand the exact functioning of each organ.\nThe processes involved are incredibly ancient. Procedures\nare handed down from generation to generation, becoming\nincreasingly ritualised and misinterpreted. For these reasons,\nthe efficiency of each organ differs from Chapter to Chapter,\ndepending on the condition of the Chapter’s gene-seed and\nthe degree of debasement of its surgical procedures. In some\nChapters, mutation of gene-seed, poor surgical procedure,\nor inadequate post-operative conditioning has twisted the\nfunctioning of implants.\nIn addition to the problem of mutated implants, many\nChapters have simply lost one or more types of gene-seed\norgans due to accident, genetic failure, or some other cause.\nVery few Chapters, therefore, possess all nineteen of the\nimplants. All possess the carapace implant however, as without\nit, the Neophyte could never become a Space Marine.\nEach of the gene-seed organs is extremely complicated.\nMany of the organs only work properly when another organ\nis present, the loss or mutation of one organ often affecting\nthe exact functioning of the others. For these reasons, implants\nmust be constantly monitored, and many Space Marines must\nundergo corrective surgery to re-balance their metabolisms.",

      "content": "of the recipient’s original heart. This implant enables Space\nMarines to survive low oxygen concentrations and traumatic\ninjury, and is also necessary in the maintenance of the subject’s\nmetabolism, which will be pushed to its limits as his body is\nsubject to the many surgical procedures it will endure over the\nnext several years.\nThe next stage in the implantation process is the addition\nof the Ossmodula. This is a tube-shaped organ whose small\nsize belies its complex structure. The Ossmodula monitors and\nsecretes hormones affecting epiphiseal fusion and ossification\nof the skeleton. At the same time, the specially engineered\nhormones encourage the forming bones to absorb ceramicbased chemicals administered in the Neophyte’s diet. Two\nyears following implantation, this will have caused considerable\nstrengthening of the long bones, extreme ossification of the\nchest cavity (caused by growth of the ribs forming a solid mass\nof inter-laced bone plates), and a general increase in the size of\nthe recipient’s skeleton.\nNormally implanted at the same time as the Ossmodula,\nthe Biscopea is emplaced within the chest cavity. It is small,\napproximately spherical and, like the Ossmodula, its primary\nfunction is hormonal. The presence of the Biscopea stimulates\nmuscle growth throughout the body. These muscles bond to\nthe rapidly growing skeleton, which is why these two implants\nare often undergone at the same time.\nPhases four and five are often implanted at the same time,\nbetween the ages of twelve and fourteen. The Haemastamen\nis a tiny organ, placed within a main blood vessel and serves\ntwo main purposes. Firstly, it monitors and to some degree\ncontrols the Ossmodula and the Biscopea. It also alters the\nconstituent make-up of the recipient’s blood. As a result, the\nSpace Marine’s blood will be considerably more efficient than\nordinary human blood, as it has to be considering the extra\nbiological hardware the Space Marine carries inside him.\nThe second implant emplaced at this time is the Larraman’s\b\nOrgan. This is a liver-shaped, dark, fleshy organ. It is implanted\ninto the chest cavity along with a complicated array of blood\nvessels. The organ generates and stores special Larraman cells.\nIf the recipient is wounded, these cells are released into the\nbloodstream, where they latch onto leucocytes in the blood\nand are transported to the site of the wound. Once outside\nthe body, the Larraman cells form a skin substitute of instant\nscar tissue, staunching the flow of blood and protecting any\nexposed wound area. This process is almost instantaneous, and\nit can appear to the onlooker as if the blood is frozen solid\neven before it hits the ground.\nWith the initiation of phase six, the subject is ready to begin\nthe extensive hypnotherapy that will continue throughout\nthe entire initiation process, and beyond. The Catalepsean\b\nNode is a brain implant usually inserted into the back of the\nskull via a hole drilled into the occipital bone. The pea-sized\norgan influences the circadian rhythms of sleep and the body’s\nresponse to sleep deprivation. Normally, a Space Marine sleeps\nlike any normal man, but if deprived of it, the Catalepsean\nNode becomes active. The recipient is capable of sleeping\nand remaining awake at the same time by switching off areas\nof the brain sequentially. This process cannot replace normal\nsleep entirely, but it increases a Space Marine’s survivability by\nallowing awareness of the environment whilst resting.\nThe next three phases of the process, the implantation\nof the Preomnor, Omophagea and Multi-lung are often\nundertaken at the same time, between the ages of fourteen\nand sixteen. The Preomnor is a large implant which fits into\nthe chest cavity. It is a pre-digestive stomach which allows\nthe recipient to eat a variety of otherwise poisonous or\nindigestible materials. No actual digestion tales place in the\nPreomnor. Instead, individual sensory tubes assess potential\npoisons and neutralise them or, where necessary, isolate the\nPreomnor from the rest of the digestive tract. The Omophagea\nis a complicated implant that is placed within the spinal cord\nbetween the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, where it becomes\nin effect part of the brain. Four nerve sheaths called neuroclea\nare implanted between the spine and the preomnoral stomach\nwall. The Omophagea is designed to absorb genetic material\ngenerated in animal tissue as a function of memory. This\nendows the Space Marine with an unusual survival trait—he\ncan actually learn by eating. If a Space Marine eats part of a\ncreature, he will absorb some of the memories of that creature.\nThis can be very useful in an alien environment. Incidentally, it\nis the presence of this organ which has created the various flesh\neating and blood drinking rituals for which many Chapters are\nknown, as well as giving the names to Chapters such as the\nBlood Drinkers and Flesh Tearers. The third organ implanted\nat this time is the Multi-lung. This large, tubular, grey organ\nis sometimes called the ‘third lung’. Blood is pumped through\nthe organ via connecting vessels grafted onto the recipient’s\npulmonary system. Atmosphere is taken in by means of a\nsphincter located in the trachea. In toxic atmospheres, an\nassociated sphincter muscle closes the trachea and restricts\nnormal breathing, thus protecting the lungs. The Multi-lung is\nable to absorb oxygen from poorly oxygenated or poisonous\nair without suffering damage thanks to its own efficient toxin\ndispersal, neutralisation, and regeneration systems.\nPhase ten of the process is the implantation of the\nOcculobe. This small slug-like organ sits at the base of the\nbrain. It provides the hormonal and genetic stimuli which\nenable a Space Marine’s eyes to respond to optic-therapy. The\nOcculobe does not in itself improve a Space Marine’s eyesight,\nbut it allows technicians to make adjustments to the growth\npatterns of the eye and the light-receptive retinal cells. A Space\nMarine has far better eyesight than a normal human, and can\nsee in low light conditions almost as well as in daylight.\nPhase eleven is the addition of the Lyman’s\bEar. This\norgan enables a Space Marine to consciously enhance and\neven filter certain types of background noise. Not only is\nhearing improved, but a Space Marine cannot become dizzy\nor nauseous as a result of extreme disorientation. A Lyman’s\nEar is externally indistinguishable from a normal human ear.\nBetween the ages of fifteen and sixteen, phase twelve is\ninitiated, in which a flat, circular organ called the Sus-an\b\nMembrane is implanted over the top of the exposed brain.\nIt then grows into the brain tissue until completely merged.\nThe organ is not effective until subsequent chemical therapy\nand training is applied. However, a properly tutored Space\nMarine may then enter into a state of suspended animation.\nThis may be a conscious action, or may happen automatically\nin the event of extreme physical trauma. In this condition,\na Space Marine may survive for many years, even if bearing",

The longest known period of\ndeanimation followed by successful reanimation is 567 years,\nin the case of Brother Silas Err of the Dark Angels Chapter.\nThe next phase of the process is the implantation of the\nMelanchromic\bOrgan. This hemispherical, black organ\nfunctions in an indirect and extremely complex manner. It\nmonitors radiation levels and types bombarding the skin,\nand if necessary, sets off chemical reactions to darken the\nskin and protect it from ultraviolet exposure. It also provides\nlimited protection from other forms of radiation. Differing\nMelanchromic Organ gene-seed from Chapter to Chapter leads\nto variations in skin and hair colour, and in some Chapters all\nof the Space Marines may have identical colouration, such as is\nfound in the albino warriors of the Death Spectres Chapter.\nPhases fourteen and fifteen, the implantation of the Oolitic\b\nKidney and the Neuroglottis, are often undertaken at the\nsame time. The Oolitic Kidney is red-brown and heart-shaped\nand improves and modifies the Space Marine’s circulatory\nsystem, enabling other implants to function effectively. The\nOolitic Kidney also filters blood extremely efficiently and\nquickly. The Secondary Heart and Oolitic Kidney are able to\nact together, performing an emergency detoxification function\nin which the Space Marine is rendered unconscious as his\nblood is circulated at high speed. This enables a Space Marine\nto survive poisons and gases which are otherwise too much\nfor even the multi-lung to cope with. The Neuroglottis enables\nthe Space Marine to assess a potential food by taste. The organ\nis implanted in the back of the mouth. By chewing, or simply\nby tasting, a Space Marine can detect a wide variety of natural\npoisons, some chemicals and even the distinctive odours of\nsome creatures. To some degree, a Space Marine is also able to\ntrack a target by taste alone.\nIn phase sixteen, normally at age sixteen, a small organ\ncalled the Mucranoid is implanted in the lower intestine\nwhere its hormonal secretions are absorbed by the colon.\nThese secretions initiate a modification of the sweat glands.\nThis modification normally makes no difference to the Space\nMarine until activated by appropriate chemical therapy. As\na result of this treatment, the Space Marine sweats an oily,\nnaturally cleansing substance which coats the skin. This\nprotects the Space Marine against extremes of temperature\nand even offers a slight degree of protection against vacuum.\nMucranoid chemical therapy is standard procedure in long\nspace voyages and when fighting in vacuum or near-vacuum.\nPhase seventeen is the implantation of two identical organs\ncalled Betcher’s\bGlands. These are placed into the lower\nlip, alongside the salivary glands or into the hard palette. The\nBetcher’s Gland works in a similar way to the poison gland of\nvenomous reptiles by synthesising and storing deadly poison.\nSpace Marines are rendered immune to this poison by virtue\nof the gland’s presence. The gland allows the Space Marine to\nspit a blinding contact poison, which is also highly corrosive.\nA Space Marine imprisoned behind iron bars could easily\nchew his way out given a few hours.\nIn the penultimate phase of the process, a pair of glands\ncalled Progenoids are implanted, one in the neck and the\nother deep in the chest cavity. This takes place between the age\nof sixteen and eighteen. These glands are vitally important to\nthe very survival of the Space Marine’s Chapter. Each organ\ngrows within the Space Marine, absorbing hormonal stimuli\nand genetic material from the other implants. After five years,\nthe neck gland is mature and ready for removal. After ten\nyears, the chest gland becomes mature and is also ready to\nbe removed. A gland may be removed any time after it has\nmatured, and it represents the Chapter’s only source of geneseed. When mature, each organ contains a single gene-seed\ncorresponding to each zygote implanted into the recipient.\nOnce removed by surgery, the Progenoid must be carefully\nprepared, its individual gene-seeds checked for mutation, and\nsound gene-seeds stored. Gene-seeds can be stored indefinitely\nunder suitable conditions.\nSpace Marine Apothecaries carry a special device known\nas a reductor, which they can use in battlefield conditions to\nremove the Progenoid glands of a fallen Space Marine, so\nthat, even should he die before his glands are harvested, they\nmay be recovered. The whole purpose of the Progenoid is to\nprovide gene-seed to enable the Chapter to continue. It is not\npossible to create a zygote in any other way. Each Chapter’s\nstock of gene-seed is therefore unique to itself. Gene-seed has\na great deal of religious significance to a Chapter, representing\nits identity and future. Without gene-seed, a Chapter has no\nfuture. The extinction of a type of gene-seed means that a\nzygote has been lost forever. The extinction of the Progenoid\ngene-seed itself would effectively mean the end to a Chapter.\nAs each Space Marine has only two Progenoid glands,\nthe rate at which a Chapter can create new Space Marines\nis restricted. It may take many years for a Chapter to rebuild\nitself after heavy losses. Gene-seed is often rendered useless if\na Space Marine is exposed to high radiation levels or other\nforms of genetic disturbance. The efficiency of different\nChapters’ Progenoid gene-seed also varies, so some Chapters\nare able to make up their numbers faster than others.\nThe final and the most distinctive implant is the Black\b\nCarapace, which cannot be implanted beyond the age of\neighteen. This looks like a film of black plastic when growing\nin the tanks. This is removed from its culture-solution and cut\ninto sheets, which are implanted directly beneath the skin of\nthe recipient’s torso. Within a few hours, the tissue expands,\nhardens on the outside, and sends invasive neural bundles\ndeep inside the subject. After several months, the recipient is\nfitted with neural sensors and transfusion points, cut into the\nhardened carapace. These artificial interface points mesh with\nfeatures integral to the power armour, such as the monitoring,\nmedicinal, and maintenance units. Without the benefit of the\nBlack Carapace, a Space Marine’s power armour would be far\nless effective.",

This combination is ideal for fast-attacking,\nclose-quarter fighting assault troops.\nEven though Tactical squads are the most common type\nin any Chapter, to earn a place in one a Space Marine must\nhave proven himself both courageous and wise in battle.\nThroughout his service in the Devastator and Assault squads,\nhe will be proven adaptable in his approach to the arts of war\nand will have mastered a range of tactics and weaponry.\nTactical squads are the most commonly fielded squad\ntypes in a Chapter. A Tactical squad is led by a Sergeant and\nincludes nine other Space Marines. Of these, seven BattleBrothers are armed with bolters, whilst the remaining two\ncan be armed with bolters or, alternatively, one may carry a\nheavy weapon such as a missile launcher or a heavy bolter,\nand the other may carry a special weapon such as a flamer or\nmeltagun. This combination is the most tactically flexible and\noffers a good mixture of capabilities within the squad.\nAfter serving in hundreds of campaigns and thousands of\nbattles, and having conquered the very worst the galaxy has\nto throw at him, a Space Marine is likely to be considered a\nVeteran. In most Chapters, such an honour is not measured\nby length of service, but in blood spilled, horrors overcome,\nand mighty deeds done. As a prelude to service in the First\n(Veteran) Company, many Space Marine Veterans fulfill the\nrole of Sergeant, leading squads of all types in any of the\nother companies. Thus, many of the Space Marines of the\nVeteran company will be battle-proven leaders as well as\nhighly experienced warriors.\nThe warriors of the Veteran company are fielded in one of\nthree squad types:\nTerminator squads wear the uniquely powerful Terminator\narmour, sometimes called tactical dreadnought armour. This\narmoured suit is massive in construction, virtually turning a\nSpace Marine into a one-man tank. Every Chapter has a limited\nnumber of Terminator armour suits, and each is an ancient\nartefact crafted many thousands of years ago. Terminators are\nless mobile than other Space Marines and are primarily used\nin boarding actions or in extreme close quarters when heavy\nfire support cannot be easily brought to bear. So resilient is\nthe armour that it is reputedly able to operate inside plasma\nreactors, within volcanoes, and inside highly irradiated areas\nof deep space. Legend has it that the armour can even survive\nthe tread of a Titan. To wear an ancient suit of Terminator\narmour is one of the greatest honours to which a Space\nMarine can aspire. Each suit bears on its left shoulder the Crux\nTerminatus, the unique badge of the Terminator. Each Crux is\nsaid to contain at its core a tiny fragment of the armour worn\nby the Emperor himself when he fought his final battle against\nthe traitor Warmaster Horus, providing a direct link between\nthe Space Marine and the Father of Mankind.\nDespite its obvious benefits, Terminator armour is not\nsuitable for all missions. Most of the time, Veterans take to the\nfield wearing ordinary power armour, albeit a suit inscribed\nwith many hundreds of battle honours. When wearing power\narmour, Veterans are formed into vanguard Veteran squads or\nsternguard Veteran squads. By dint of their rank, Veterans have\naccess to the most fearsome weaponry in the Chapter’s arsenal,\nincluding sacred blades and artificer-crafted combi-weapons\nof uniquely masterful craftsmanship. Vanguard Veteran\nsquads go to battle equipped with the most lethal of close\ncombat weapons, and often wear jump packs to bring them\nto bear before the enemy can even react. Sternguard Veteran\nsquads carry a wide array of ranged weaponry and specialised\nammunition, and are masters in its overwhelming application.\nVeteran squads are rarely deployed en masse, but are instead\nused to bolster the line, provide an unstoppable speartip or to\nact as a highly flexible and mobile reserve.\nMASTERS OF THE cHAPTER\nEach of the Chapter’s ten companies is led by a Captain.\nThese leaders are second in experience only to the Chapter\nMaster himself, and each is a warrior so deadly that he will\nrarely meet his match. Each Captain is an inspirational and\ndetermined leader, able to coordinate the Space Marines under\nhis command whatever the opposition. In addition to leading\nSpace Marines in battle, each Captain holds titles dependent\non his other responsibilities with regard to the workings of\nthe Chapter or its home world, such as Master of the Fleet or\nMaster of the Marches.\nOf the thousand awesome and terrifying warriors that\ncomprise a Space Marine Chapter, there is but one Chapter\nMaster, a leader with centuries of experience in the very\ncrucible of battle. His own fighting skills will be unsurpassed,\nwhether in the use of gun, blade, or bare hands. His very\nrank speaks of a past littered with the bodies of bloodied,\nbeaten foes of the most terrifying and inhuman sort. It is not\nenough, however, for the Chapter Master to be its foremost\nwarrior. He must also be a superb tactician, grounded in the\nteachings of the Codex Astartes and honed through countless\ndecisions made in the maelstrom of close action. His soldiers\nare also his brothers, and he knows that they will give their\nlives at his command. He must preserve these magnificent\nfighters, but must also accomplish his mission and uphold the\nhonour of his Chapter. He will be steeped in the lore of his\nChapter and be sworn to keep its secrets and must conduct\nhis diplomacy accordingly, for Space Marines maintain a web\nof time-proven oaths and honours debts and do not simply\nheed the commands of Imperial functionaries. Those who\nwish a Chapter Master to send his warriors into battle must\ngive him good reason to do so. In addition to this, a Chapter\nMaster will often be the ruler of his Chapter’s home world, a\nresource that is too valuable for him to ignore. Amongst the\ngreatest risks facing a Chapter Master is the very power he\nwields, for a Chapter of Space Marines is a force capable of\ndevastating entire worlds at his order.\nEven a Space Marine can feel pride, ferocity, and desire—\nit is, after all, their hero’s soul that drives them to acts of\nselfless sacrifice. But in these things lie the seeds of hubris\nthat can eventually lead to damnation. Any Space Marine, but\nespecially a Chapter Master, must beware the short path to\nvictory, must consider both the ends and the means, and must\nheed the example of Emperor and Primarch.",

However, if you\nhave difficulty coming up with a name on the spot (like many\nother gamers!), this section will help guide you in creating a\ngreat name for your Space Marine.\nNames within the 41st Millennium are as varied as the\nmany thousands of worlds that make up the Imperium. As\nmankind is an inventive and contrary creature, there are no\nstandard or universal conventions that govern the names\npeople give themselves. In some places, a single simple name\nmight indicate low birth and ignominy, whilst in others,\nit might act as a mark of extreme wealth, fame, and good\nbreeding. When deciding upon a name, feel free to mix and\nmatch any of the suggestions made by the naming tables. The\nidea, of course, is to create a name that suits your character—\nand no one knows more about your character than you do!\nother warhaMMer 40,000 roleplaY CharaCterS anD DeathwatCh\nThe most important information for players of Dark heresy and rogue traDer is that Deathwatch uses the same\ncore mechanics and takes place in the same universe. There are some theme-related differences in the rules between these\ngames, but Dark heresy and rogue traDer players should feel right at home with the way the game itself works.\nIt is important to note that Deathwatch Space Marines are quite powerful (particularly in combat!) in relation to\nDark heresy and rogue traDer characters. A rogue traDer character with 14,000 xp is roughly equivalent to a\nRank 1 Deathwatch Space Marine (in that the Rogue Trader has a great deal of power tied up in his wealth and personal\nstarship!), and a Dark heresy character using an Ascended Career from ascension with 14,000 xp is also roughly equal\n(having his own strengths in regards to Influence, many knowledge and investigative skills, and so forth). It is strongly\nrecommended that the GM consider carefully before mixing Space Marines into Dark heresy and rogue traDer\ncampaigns, because the Space Marine’s combat abilities are significantly higher than any other type of character.\nDark heresy characters using ascension are particularly recommended if you wish to combine the two games. An\nOrdo Xenos Inquisitor and his trusted Throne Agents are quite appropriate to accompany a Deathwatch Space Marine\n(or even an entire Kill-team) on a mission, or set of missions, of particular import.\nrequiSition & warhaMMer 40,000 roleplaY\nIt is assumed that, in Deathwatch, characters from other Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay games have some special\ndispensation to accompany the Space Marines on their missions (for instance, if one of the player characters is an\nInquisitor). Throne Gelt and a Rogue Trader’s Profit Factor have no meaning for the Deathwatch. Therefore, the other\ncharacters also benefit from the Requisition rules and may acquire Renown at the GM’s discretion (see pages 138–141\nfor more information about Requisition and Renown).\nIf a Deathwatch character joins a Dark heresy or rogue traDer game, the GM is encouraged to determine a\nfair method of applying Requisition to the Space Marine character rather than participating in Profit Factor, Influence,\nor Throne Gelt (all of these terms are explained in rogue traDer, ascension, and Dark heresy, respectively).

Having proved himself to the\nknightly order that defended the peoples of Caliban from the Chaos beasts of the dark forests, Jonson quickly\nrose to power and led a crusade to slay the beasts and deliver the people of Caliban from their evil.\nThe Lion was said to have been temperamental and taciturn, but a brilliant strategist and unstoppable once decided\nupon a course of action. These qualities served him well when he reunited with the Emperor and led the Dark\nAngels Legion in the Great Crusade. One of the great tragedies of the Horus Heresy is that while Jonson earned\nglory amongst the stars, Luther, his closest friend and trusted second in command, turned against him, leading\nthose Space Marines who remained on Caliban to the service of Chaos. Returning to Caliban, Jonson discovered\nhis blood-brother’s treachery. So terrible was his vengeance, so bitter his sense of betrayal, that the ensuing battle\nsaw the destruction of Caliban itself. At the conclusion of the battle, the traitor Luther was captured by the loyal\nDark Angels, but of the Lion, there was no trace.",

The idea that outsiders are not to be trusted is drilled into\nthe recruits from an early stage, and they are tested continuously to ensure their compliance until it becomes second nature.\nAfter all, a brother who cannot be entirely trusted to keep the Chapter’s secrets is unlikely to advance through its ranks.\nAlthough the Dark Angels have fought beside all of the branches of the Imperium’s vast military machine, they prefer\nto stand beside other Space Marines. Many, even brother Astartes, find the Dark Angels aloof and uncommunicative. The\nDark Angels, for their part are impatient and unforgiving with strangers who pry into their affairs. In truth, those Dark\nAngels who are aware of the existence of the Fallen are ever watchful for any sign of their activity, and will abandon\nwhatever mission they are about should they gain any clue that one is nearby. In theory, even a Dark Angel seconded to\nthe Deathwatch could go “off mission” in this manner, although the annals of Watch Fortress Erioch do not relate any such\nincident taking place.\nThe Dark Angels are also notoriously intolerant of non-humans and will often refuse to fight alongside armies that\ninclude abhuman warriors or alien races. They are highly suspicious of outsiders and often appear unreasonably aloof and\nintransigent. Indeed, there have been a number of occasions where Dark Angels have withdrawn suddenly and with no\nexplanation from a warzone when confronted by an Inquisitor or missionary.\nDespite such incidents, many Dark Angels have served with distinction and honour in the Deathwatch. Their taciturn\nnature and stubborn refusal to accept anything other than total victory over their foes has served the Deathwatch well, and\nseveral noted Watch Commanders are drawn from the Chapter. These keep in close contact with one another, coordinating\nthe efforts of the Deathwatch across entire sectors of the Imperium.",

They are invariably fitted with a device called a\nshot selector, which allows the brother to quickly chamber\none of the many specialised types of bolter ammunition\nthat the Deathwatch utilises, and engage any foe that may\npresent itself.\nIt is the use of this specialised ammunition that makes the\nDeathwatch Tactical Marine such a fearsome and highly flexible\nwarrior. Hellfire rounds for example, have been introduced\nfollowing the lessons learned in costly battles against Hive\nFleet Behemoth, each containing a small payload of mutogenic\nacid that is devastating to organic matter. Dragonfire rounds\nexplode on contact with their foe, erupting in a burst of\nincandescent chemical fire that soon engulfs the target.\nKraken rounds contain a super-dense core that affords them\nimproved range and penetration compared to a conventional\nround, making them ideal against heavily armoured targets.\nMetal Storm rounds are examples of highly sophisticated and\nbarely understood technology, a miniscule proximity detector\ntriggering the round’s detonation microseconds before impact,\nand lacerating the foe with thousands of razor-sharp fragments,\ncausing him to bleed out in seconds. Stalker shells are optimised\nfor range and stealth, allowing a Tactical Marine to use his\nbolter as a makeshift sniper rifle, increasing his flexibility and\nlethality still further.\nThis huge range of ammunition types means that the\nDeathwatch Tactical Marine can face a wide range of foes,\nand the shot selector allows him to switch, even in the heat of\nbattle, from one to the next. Some Tactical Marines,\nhowever, choose to specialise instead of\ntaking this all-round approach.
