Anyone who \nsees them knows in his soul they are the God-Emperor’s creations. \nMore than that, you know that through them He is still watching \nover us.”\n–Corporal Drayle after a Kill-team rescue on Baraban\nW\nelcome to The Emperor Protects, a three–part \nadventure supplement for the Deathwatch \nRoleplaying Game� These events take a \nDeathwatch Kill–Team on a desperate mission that will lead \nthe Battle–Brothers throughout the Jericho Reach and pit \nthem against the unspeakable forces of Chaos. The adventures \nherein take the Kill–Team across the Reach in an attempt \nto stop a Chaos Sorcerer from enacting his plans for total \ndomination of the region; by destroying the warp gate used \nto supply the ongoing Achilus Crusade. In order for the Kill–\nTeam to prevent this from coming to pass they will confront \nhorrifying xenos, canny agents of Chaos, and even face their \ntraitorous brethren from the Alpha Legion.\nGAME MASTER’S BRIEFING\nthe emperor protects takes the form of three adventures, \neach linked together by a common story arc. The adventures \ncan be played through sequentially (the conclusion of one \nleading straight into the opening of the next), or the action \ncan be broken up and rearranged in any manner desired.\nThe adventures are set in the Jericho Reach, a war–torn \nregion of space on the Eastern Fringe of the galaxy.\nthe emperor protects also explores a range of subjects \nand play styles, from extreme action to diplomacy, and \nexploration to epic combat. As befits the Battle–Brothers’ role \nand position as Space Marines of the Deathwatch, each of \nthese challenges must be overcome if they are to survive and \ntriumph in the face of adversity.\nAt the beginning of each of the three adventures, Game \nMasters will find advice on how to use each adventure on \nits own, and how they can integrate the events into their   \nown campaign.\nBAcKGROUND\nThe events of the emperor protects begin with the Chaos \nSorcerer Dahzak—a man who is consumed by ambition and \nhas a lust for power. His quest for knowledge brought him to \nthe Cellebos Warzone along with so many other splinters of \nthe various Traitor Legions. Gleaning dark secrets in the ruins \nof the Charon Stars, he conceived a plan to twist the Jericho \nReach’s mysterious warp gate to his own ends.\nDahzak’s plans begin with an arcane piece of technology \ncalled a thaumagramm diode. The diodes are devices that can \nbe used to manipulate space–time to open a breach into the \nImmaterium. Dahzak came across the plans for these warp–\naltering devices in his unending quest for forbidden lore. \nAs he came to understand what the diodes were capable of, \nhe saw his opportunity. He also saw that he would never be \ncapable of constructing and attuning the diodes on his own. \nTo that end, he sought out allies skilled not just in technology, \nbut used to integrating it with warp energies.\nHe found that ally in a group called the Vinculum \nProselytes. This order of corrupt Magi on Samech has delved \ninto the forbidden mysteries of tech–heresy for centuries, and \nthe “improvements” Chaos can bring to it. \nWithin their Forge, Dahzak and the Vinculum Proselytes \nbegan to construct the thaumagramm diodes. It quickly \nbecame apparent that their understanding of special \nmanipulation was insufficient for the task. They rectified this \nproblem by seeking the aid of the Alpha Legion. With their \nsubtle and well–planned tactics, they have helped the Irradial \nForge acquire many important inputs to the diodes.\nDahzak and the Irradial Forge have another obstacle aside \nfrom the difficulty of constructing the diodes. Even if a ship \ncould penetrate the Iron Collar and reach the warp gate in \nthe Well of Night, it would still have a patrolling Adeptus \nMechanicus cruiser to deal with. A scout ship, which would \nbe ideal for sneaking past the blockade, would not be able to \nstand up to the punishment that can be meted out by one of \nthese vessels. \nThus, the group must find some way to get a larger ship \nto the warp gate without being destroyed in the process \nof trying to penetrate the Iron Collar. To that end, Magos \nVayze, leader of the Vinculum Proselytes, has hit upon the \nsolution: Antisonate plating. This special and unique plating \nis typically used to cloak some of the best stealth craft in the \nReach. However, in addition to being rare and costly, it is \nineffective on large vessels. To allow the plating to maintain \nits stealth properties over a larger surface area, Vayze has \ncombined the Antisonate with rare Decavane crystals. The \nVinculum Proselytes have gone to great lengths to establish a \nsecret mining operation on an out of the way planet, where \nthey slowly accumulate the necessary quantities of Decavane. \nAt the Irradial Forge, construction of their stealth warship, \nthe Ruin Bringer, is nearly complete; and Vayze and Dahzak \nhave almost perfected the thaumagramm diodes. \nDahzak however, has no army, as he operates with only \nhis apprentice, Sethahar, to aid him. His plans for the warp \ngate are too grand a scheme to carry out without additional \nsupport and Dahzak knows that his sorcerous knowledge will \nnot be enough. To bolster his numbers and execute the many \ninfiltrations required, Dahzak has allied with a cell of Alpha \nLegion operating in the Jericho Reach, led by Lamdus Rize. \nCombined with the corrupt techno–magi of the Proselytes, \nwhat terrible ambition could bring these three forces together? \nDahzak has spun a vision of the gate transformed into an \nopen breach to the warp, both cutting off further support for \nthe Achilus Crusade and flooding the reach with the creatures \nof Chaos. Should they manage to succeed, the entire Jericho \nReach may be turned over to the flood of Chaos.\n4\n\nIntroduction\nSynopSiS\nthe emperor protects is a multi–adventure supplement that \nis broken down into three distinct, and linked, adventures. As \nstated previously, these adventures can be run in the sequence \nthey are presented in, or they can be run in whatever order \nthe GM deems appropriate.\nBelow are brief synopses of each adventure within this \nsupplement. The beginning of each adventure provides \ninformation on how to run it, and additional information the \nGM needs should he wish to adjust each adventure to fit into \nhis group’s play styles and campaign events.\nAdventure One: The Price of Hubris\nThe Price of Hubris begins with a Rogue Trader by the name \nof Diaz Lan bringing the Crusade’s request for aid with the \nworld of Aurum, to the Deathwatch’s attention. Assigned to \nassist the Crusade with helping to bring the world into the \nfold of the Imperium, the Rogue Trader transports the Kill–\nTeam on his ship, the Horizon’s Pride. \nOnce they arrive at Aurum, the Battle–Brothers must \ndetermine if the world not only harbours the taint of the \nxenos, but also win over the fierce natives. However, in the \ncourse of their duties, the Kill–Team discovers that Aurum \nharbours a most deadly secret that the natives have been \ntrying to keep: Genestealers.\nAdventure Two: A Stony Sleep\nIn the adventure, A Stony Sleep, the Kill–Team is sent to the \nworld of Karlack in order to discover what happened to an \nOrdo Xenos Inquisitor by the name of Vincent. Contacted by \nhis colleague, Inquisitor Quist, the Battle–Brothers soon find \nthemselves within the grips of a trap devised by the Traitor \nLegion of Space Marines called the Alpha Legion.\nMasquerading as Space Marines from the Black Templars \nChapter, the Alpha Legion managed to gather up the \nsecrets of the planet’s long–dead xenos inhabitants from the \nmissing Inquisitor. As the Battle–Brothers follow their own \ninvestigation, they encounter members of a xenos–cult called \nthe Reborn. The trail eventually leads them to the city of \nKar’thir where they discover a terrible threat looming within \nthe xenos ruins sunken beneath the oceans.\nTracking their foes to an island chain, the Kill–Team \ndiscovers that the Chaos Space Marines they have been \nfollowing have initiated a series of events that could lead to the \nrise of an alien war host within the very heart of the Crusade’s \nconquered territory. If the valiant Deathwatch cannot find a \nway to stop the Alpha Legion’s efforts, then Karlack will find \nitself overwhelmed under a tide of alien ruin.\nAdventure Three: Sword of Vigilance\nWhen the adventure Sword of Vigilance begins, the Deathwatch \nhas deciphered the meanings of their findings on Karlack and \nAurum, and realises that there is an unholy alliance on Samech. \nIt appears they mean to target the Warp Gate. The Battle–\nBrothers bring this threat before the Chamber of Vigilance. \nThere, the Kill–Team is charged with entering the corrupt \nmechanical heart of Samech, and halting the heretics’ scheme \nbefore it launches.\nArriving on Samech, the Battle–Brothers encounter the \ntriumvirate’s ultimate triumph, the stealth–warship Ruin Bringer. \nSoliciting the aid of several potential allies, the Kill–Team \nfights a desperate battle to destroy the monstrosity created \nby corrupted minds, and from there are able to penetrate \nthe Irradial Forge. From here, the Kill–Team discovers the \nthaumagramm diodes and will finally meet their arch–enemies \nthat have plagued them across the whole of the Jericho Reach.\nRUNNING THE EMPEROR \nPROTEcTS\nthe emperor protectsreflects the culmination of a plot \nmeasured in decades. The GM is welcome to run additional \nMissions between the adventures provided herein. As the plots \nare put together in the third adventure, the order of the first \ntwo Missions is interchangeable—although the escalation \nplays out better if run in order. \nIn the order presented, the Kill–Team first determines the \nfate of a planet, then a Salient, and then the entire Crusade. \nThis book also builds the story by accumulating information \nover multiple Missions. The effectiveness of this technique \ncan be enhanced by ensuring good notes are taken by the \nGM and/or the players. The Missions also offer options for \na less player–driven approach to initiation if this is a problem \nfor your group. However, letting the players move the story \nforward is a more engaging experience for them. The GM \ncan help with retention by re–iterating the key plot points \ndiscovered so far at the beginning of every game session.\nThe enemy profiles and numbers in the Missions assume a \nKill–Team of 5 Battle–Brothers between Ranks 1 through 4. \nThe difficulty can easily be scaled by changing the number of \nadversaries in any encounter. In a few instances other facets \nmust be scaled, and those are noted in the individual Missions. \nAdditionally, the adventures within the emperor protects\nare not recommended for beginning Battle–Brothers. At a \nminimum, members of the Kill–Team should have at least \nan additional 1,000 experience points (XPs) on top of the \namount already given to them during character creation. \nThus, all Battle–Brothers participating in the emperor \nprotects should have at least 14,000 XPs. The Game Master \nis welcome to adjust this amount as he sees fit.\nMiSSion ConSequenCeS\nSpace Marines make important decisions; their presence can \ntip the scales of power. Sometimes they may not even realise \nthe profound effect they have on the events around them \nuntil later. As the Kill–Team progresses through the first \ntwo adventures, many choices come before them. Several of \nthese have ramifications in the sworD of Vigilance, which \nis the climax Mission. the sworD of Vigilanceopens with \na summary of what those choices and consequences are. It’s \nstrongly recommended that the GM track what the Kill–Team \ndecides for each choice throughout the emperor protects.\n5\n\nIntroduction\noptional and Conditional \nenCounterS\nEvery group has their own preferences for pacing and the \npercentage of time spent in combat. Some of the encounters \nin the emperor protectsare labelled as Optional. The \nnarrative is cohesive with or without these incidents, and the \nGM can choose which ones he wants to include to set the \nappropriate pace for his group. The third Mission also uses \nConditional encounters. These are simply extensions of the \nMission Consequences. Each conditional encounter opens \nwith the circumstances that trigger its occurrence. As always, \nboth the Conditions and the entire Consequences concept are \nsuggestions, not mandates. You can opt to include or exclude \nwhatever fits best in your campaign and play style.\nenCounter CirCuMStanCeS\nA number of the encounters in this book have special \ncircumstances governing the relevant challenge. Quick \nreference handouts are provided in the Appendix to make \nthese encounters easier for the GM to run and the players \nto play. The handouts deliberately place the statistical effect \nas the last column. This allows the GM to decide whether \nhe wants the players to know the exact rules governing the \nsituation, or to cut off the last column and convey things only \nin narrative terms.\nIf the GM is a beginner, he may want to ignore all the \nsituational modifiers until he is more comfortable with the \noverall rules. The GM should also consider the experience \nlevel of his players when introducing this supplement to   \nhis group.\ndraMatiS perSonae\nBelow are the central antagonists of the overall plot. Their \nprofiles can be found in the Missions where they are first \nencountered.\nDahzak\nDahzak is a powerful sorcerer, and especially gifted in seeing \nthe future. This ability has served him well in his quest to \nimprove his knowledge and power. In Dahzak’s many years \nhe has commanded armies, and he has roamed dead stars \nalone. Recently, until needing the Vinculum Proselytes, he \nhad but a single apprentice. Dahzak’s charisma comes from \nhis certainty. His claims that he knows every possibility \nare quite compelling. They are also quite false. Dahzak is \ncertainly an exceptional diviner, but that art is fickle even for \nthe best master. He overplays his confidence in predictions \n(and sometimes fabricates them entirely) when it serves   \nhis purpose.\nLamdus Rize\nLamdus has been the head of his Alpha Legion cell for \ndecades. Like many such cells, the bonds of loyalty between \nthe Traitor Space Marines within it are strong. The same can \nhardly be said for how they view their allies. Lamdus is well \naware that he and his men are simply tools of convenience to \nDahzak and the Irradial Forge. However, his best opportunity \nto sabotage the warp gate is to play along, for now. \nMagos Vayze\nMagos Vayze is the senior tech-priest of the Vinculum \nProselytes. While the thaumagramm diodes are fascinating \nand cutting off the Crusade can only be positive for Samech, \nthese apostate Mechanicus do nothing without a price. In \nDahzak’s case, the Proselytes demanded the sorcerer free \nthem from the constraints of the flesh so that they could be \ntruly one with the machine. The results were not exactly as \nexpected, leaving all of the Magi dependent upon sorcery to \nsustain them. Still, it was satisfactory to buy the services of \nthe Irradial Forge. Vayze is not eager to see Dahzak’s plans \nenacted, as it leaves the Proselytes without a counterbalance \nto their dependence on the sorcerer’s powers.\nSethahar \nSethahar is Dahzak’s apprentice. While his master favours \ndivination, Sethahar excels in destructive magic. He is \nquiet and brooding individual, whose temper can lash out   \nunexpectedly and with all the destructive force of his sorcery. \nDahzak entrusts him with many important tasks, secure that \nthey both know if his apprentice was to scheme against him, \nthe diviner would see it coming.\ntreaChery BegetS treaChery\nThe tenuous alliance of these wretched powers only \nstands to prove why such unions are seldom successful. \nIn reality, all three forces have their own designs for \nthe warp gate. Dahzak believes the gate can be used to \nbreach the Eldar webways, and grant him the elusive \ngoal of entrance to the Black Library. While the diodes \ncan enslave and defile a machine spirit, directing their \npurpose still requires the talents of a psyker. Herein \nlays Dahzak’s opportunity to take control. The Alpha \nLegion desires to cut off the Crusade’s supply of troops \nand resources, an opportunity that appeals to them \ngreatly. These Chaos Space Marines secretly plan to \nsabotage the tech sorcery and destroy the warp gate \ninstead of corrupting it. Meanwhile, the Vinculum \nProselytes support the stated plan, to twist and corrupt \nthe Warp Gate to create a breach into the empyrean \nand flood the region with the energies of the warp.\n6\n\nnowhere elSe to \nturn\n•\nthe golden \nplanet\n•\nthe diveSted \nhunt\n•\nthe tainted City\n•\nthe heroeS’ \nreturn\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\n+++To: Lord GeneraL CasTus IaCTon+++ \n+++From: Keybor Tayne, PrImary LexoGraPher+++\n+++subjeCT: ConTaCT hIsTory wITh aurum+++\nas  requested,  I  have  compiled  a  chronological  account  of  our  attempts  to  establish \nrelations with the natives of the planet designated: aurum.

If  these  primitives \nonly respect strength, we will send them the Deathwatch. \nOne  way  or  the  other,  Aurum \nwill  be  brought  into \ncompliance.\n–Inquisitor Quist\n8\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe Price of \nHubris\n“We shall not capitulate to the demands of these grasping xenos, \nbrothers. This ground holds one of our own, a hero whose bravery \nwe shall not betray with defeat. We will defend his honour; we will \ndefend our Chapter’s honour, to the last drop of our blood.”\n–from Marneus Calgar’s address at the Battle of the \nSepulchre\nI\nn the face of war, murderous xenos, the vengeful agents of \nChaos, and the many other threats of the Jericho Reach, \nthe true purpose of the Achilus Crusade is sometimes lost. \nThe Crusade is first and foremost an attempt to bring the \nReach back under Imperial control. At present, the Crusade \nis far from self-sustaining. Troops, rations, ammunition, \nand virtually every other component of the trident assault \nmust flow through the Warp gate, secretly siphoned from \nSegmentum Obscurus. The Crusade’s masters recognise that \nsooner or later either the resources or the secrecy that sustains \ntheir lifeline will give out, so establishing more fortresses \nand agricultural centres like the agri-world of Karlack is an \nimportant goal.\nFor this reason, the Crusade’s leaders have been eying the \nferal world of Aurum for decades. The exceptionally fertile \nplanet would make a fine addition to the Crusade’s woefully \nsmall portfolio of pacified worlds. Because the Crusade is \nalready fighting on many fronts, the Imperium would much \nrather incorporate it peacefully than turn Aurum into one \nmore war zone.\nThe Crusade has tried tactic after tactic to negotiate with \nthe stubborn and prideful feral worlders, but the natives’ \nreception has been lukewarm at best. Despite Aurum’s \nprecarious position between the oncoming Hive Dagon and \nthe turbulent Cellebos Warzone, the planet’s leader, Caele \nRylus Darkscourge, refuses to cede his world to outsider \nauthority peacefully. Recently, relations have suddenly grown \neven more strained, as the bodies of both natives and Imperial \nmissionaries have been found picked clean of flesh with an \nefficiency far surpassing any native predator. Auran authorities \nhave refused to cooperate with the Imperials on-planet in \ninvestigating the killings, and many Imperials have begun to \nwonder if their lack of cooperation masks something more \nsinister than stubborn pride. Recently, tensions reached the \nboiling point when an Adeptus Sororitas sister was found \ndead under mysterious circumstances. \nThe Crusade has called upon the Battle-Brothers not only \nto determine if Aurum harbours an alien foe, but also to \nrepresent the best of humanity to a warrior culture. If anyone \nstands a chance of winning over the fierce Aurans, it is the \nEmperor’s finest.\nOVERVIEw\nDiaz Lan is a Rogue Trader and liaison between the \nDeathwatch and the Achilus Crusade. He comes to Erioch \nrequesting the Battle-Brothers’ aid with the uncooperative \nAurans. If the Space Marines cannot convince the natives \nto trust the Imperium, they can at least seek out and purge \nwhatever foe the planet hides. Lan transports the Kill-team on \nhis ship, where they may contend with secrets and sabotage \nbefore reaching the planet.\nRylus Darkscourge is the Caele of Aurum; his title \ncommands loyalty from the planet’s many tribes and nascent \ncities. He rules from the cliff-top settlement of Haistand, \nwhere the Battle-Brothers arrive, and which the Caele’s \nlaws confine them to. The Battle-Brothers can choose to \ninvestigate matters in the city and meet with Rylus, who \noffers them a chance to win answers diplomatically through a \nproving called the Divested Hunt. At the opposite end of this \nspectrum, they may ignore the Aurans’ dictates entirely and \nfollow their investigation into the wilds of Aurum—although \nthis brings the planet to the brink of war.\nWhether they spark hostilities or soothe them, the Kill-\nteam eventually learns what the Aurans are trying so hard \nto hide. The canyon settlement of Grensvayl is infected with \nGenestealers, and the Aurans’ pride will not let them ask for \nhelp even as they slowly lose the battle to keep the aliens \ncontained. The Battle-Brothers enter the ruined city to do \nwhat the Aurans could not.\n9\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nHowever, the Broodlord, the fearsome master of the \nGenestealer brood, has already escaped its prison. The Adeptus \nAstartes must summon all their battle prowess to keep this \nxenos horror from decimating both friend and foe—and from \nescaping Aurum to infect another unsuspecting world. \ncHOIcE, cONSEqUENcE, \nAND HUBRIS\nThe overarching theme of this Mission is pride. The Aurans \nhave spurned many Imperial offers of help with their \nproblems because they consider themselves better than the \nImperium. Their stubborm arrogance reflects what an Adeptus \nAstartes who falls prey to hubris might become. Fittingly, the \nBattle-Brothers may find themselves receiving a good deal \nless respect than they are used to, and as a result the Battle-\nBrothers’ own pride could jeopardise their mission as surely \nas the Caele’s could doom his planet. \nAlthough they are proud, the Aurans have many virtues \nsuch as courage, honesty, and strength at arms. They should \nbe portrayed in a balanced manner, as the Mission has more \nimpact if the Kill-team feels some connection to these warrior \npeople. The Auran leader, Rylus, is a noble figure who the \nSpace Marines hopefully view as a rival worthy of making \npeace with. That is certainly how he perceives them at the \nMission’s beginning.\nSince the situation on Aurum is very politically charged, \nthe Battle-Brothers’ choices will drastically affect the way The \nPrice of Hubris plays out. They have the opportunity to win a \ngreat prize for the Imperium and be lauded as the heroes of a \nplanet. However, they could also spark a bloody war that costs \nmany lives. Every GM knows that you can never predict what \nyour players will do. This adventure presents the encounters \nmost likely to happen if the Battle-Brothers achieve all their \nobjectives, and provides guidance on what may occur if they \ndecide to bring war instead of peace to Aurum.\nThe Mission comprises a set of components, which may \noccur in a variety of orders, or may need to be skipped or \naltered depending on the Kill-team’s choices. The key to \nrunning a componentised adventure is to balance the effects \nof the players’ choices with telling an interesting story. When \nplausible, take the opportunity to use some form of the given \nencounters to extend conflicts and create an engaging story. \nHowever, don’t force encounters on your players if they \nworked to anticipate or avoid them, lest they feel herded into \none outcome regardless of their actions. Use the following \nguide posts for how events unfold:\n•Rylus does not assent to the Space Marines going to \nGrensvayl without a Proving, no matter how compelling \ntheir argument. They may go anyway, either through \nstealth or open defiance.\n•Rylus is driven by tradition. He celebrates the purge of \nGrensvayl even if the Kill-team did not gain his approval \nand even if they refuse to attend the celebration, as long \nas they are not at war from openly defying him.\n•If war breaks out, the focus of the story may shift to \nthat conflict for a time, but the Battle-Brothers can still \nachieve the Objective of purging the xenos even in the \nmidst of war. They also have numerous opportunities to \npull the planet back from war if they choose to do so.\nIn this adventure, the Primary Objectives are clear from \nthe onset of the Mission, and it is important to make sure the \nplayers are clear on what they are, and remember them. This \nadventure will take most gaming groups multiple sessions; \nit is a good idea to review the Primary Objectives at the \nbeginning of each session.\nuSing the priCe of huBriS aS a \nStandalone MiSSion\nIf you wish to run this Mission alone, rather than as \na part of the emperor protectstrilogy, remove \nthe thaumagramm diode schematic and the radial \nof Chaos from the apostate magi’s compound in the \ncaves. Samech’s corrupt Machine Cult hardly needs an \nambitious assault plan to covet Decavane crystals for \nthe potent energy cores they can create. \n10\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nNowhere Else \nto Turn\nT\nhe Battle-Brothers’ introduction to Aurum begins \nwith a visit from Diaz Lan. The Kill-team’s Watch \nCaptain has already accepted the Mission at the time \nhe sends the Battle-Brothers to hear Lan’s request, although \nhe has not yet informed Lan of his decision. (Depending \non his nature, he may suggest the Kill-team withhold this \nfact from Lan until the end of the briefing, as it is important \nthat the Crusade never take the aid of the Deathwatch for \ngranted). The Deathwatch has arranged for Lan’s audience on \na platform overlooking one of the Watch Station’s numerous \npractice ranges. This one is for arctic training, and the sound \nof live-fire exercises billows up with the frigid air. (If the GM \nhas established any other Kill-teams stationed on Erioch, he \nmay wish to personalise the background events with their \npractice.) \nLan is waiting (and appears to have been waiting for \nsome time) when the Battle-Brothers reach the riveted metal \nplatform. He is swathed in a cruxermine fur cloak, which he \nis holding tight around his trim frame. Ice particles cling to \nhis short silver hair. Behind him, an artificial wind whips the \nfrozen range into a field of white, where harsh icy shapes \noccasionally appear in the brief interludes of calm. Scattered \nbursts of distant bolter fire evidence that the range is in \nuse. Any Battle-Brothers not in power armour feel a slight \nchill, but their mucranoid organ largely protects them from \nthe bitter cold. Read aloud or paraphrase the following as   \nthey enter:\nThe Rogue Trader straightens as you enter, pulling his fur-lined \ncloak tighter around him. “Thank you for seeing me. I would \noffer you a seat or a draft of amasec, but I find myself a bit ah – \nshort-staffed at the moment. Not to question your hospitality of \ncourse.” A salvo of exploding melta charges booms behind him, \nmomentarily illuminating the snow field.\nThe pause in the conversation creates an opportunity for \nthe Battle-Brothers to comment or ask questions. When the \ntopic turns back to the Mission, Lan proceeds while pacing \nback and forth:\n“My humblest apologies if you have already heard something of \nour plight. I will be frank with you. The Lord Militant believes \nthat some kind of alien creature has descended upon Aurum. I’m \nsure venerable warriors such as yourselves will be more than a \nmatch for it. However, the truth that the Crusade needs your help \nin another matter on that planet—possibly one that only you can \naddress. Aurum is a valuable world, and its people did not turn \nto dark powers during the Age of Shadow.”\n“However, they have proved remarkably resistant to negotiation. \nTheir leader, a devil of a warrior who calls himself Rylus \nDarkscourge, won’t permit any sizeable Imperial detachments to \nland, nor will he allow our people to stray beyond their capital \ncity. Some over-zealous prospectors tried to stray beyond these \nedicts once, and their deaths nearly shattered our fragile peace. \nThe Aurans are a proud people, and the truth is I think they’re \nnot impressed by us. We could pacify the world, but the last \nthing we need is one more population held by force instead of \nfaith.” Behind him, the black outlines of the drilling Kill-team \nappear like shadows in the man-made blizzard. He watches their \nperfectly coordinated movements for a moment before turning \nback. “You may find this ironic, but the Adeptus Astartes might \nbe our last chance for peace on Aurum.” \nLan answers their questions to the best of his ability. If \nthe Battle-Brothers ask about why the world is so important, \nLan explains the presence of the Decavane crystals, as well \nas the extraordinary agricultural opportunities it presents. \nHe also provides what information he has on the recent \ndeaths. Since 783.M41, the Imperium has had a presence in \nHaistand, which passes for Aurum’s capital city. Small groups \nof diplomats and missionaries have resolutely persisted \nin their efforts to forge a lasting alliance with the natives. \nBoth the previous and current Caele allowed Imperials to \nland, but not to venture beyond Haistand. Over the last few \nyears, the missionaries have observed an unusual number of \ndisappearances; these events are doubly suspicious because \nthe populace, and the Caele in particular, meet inquiries \nwith stony silence. The situation came to a head when Sister \nRachayel, a Sister Hospitaller accompanying the Ecclesiarchy, \nwas found dead. As Lan describes it:\n“Her body was found in the Mission, with her own dagger \nthrough her chest. The locals were eager to call it a suicide due \nto a weak spirit. She may not have been a Sister of Battle, but no \nloyal member of her order would throw away her life. And there \nhave been other deaths. Perhaps just a few, perhaps many. It’s hard \nto say as the Aurans seem to be concealing them from us. The few \nbodies we’ve seen were meticulously stripped of everything: flesh, \nskin, blood. Some had deep grooves in the ribcage and arms, as \nthough something had cleaved through to the bone itself.” \n“Since the Imperium has been unable to survey beyond Haistand, \nsome sort of xenos could easily occupy other regions of the planet. \nPerhaps the Aurans even know. I shudder to think that they may \neven be thrall to some alien presence we know nothing about. \nIt could be why they are so insistent not to let us go beyond the \nsingle city. Whatever is behind this, I’d say there is more than the \nImperium bargained for on Aurum.”\n11\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nBecause of the Caele’s restrictions on travel, planetary data \non Aurum is limited. Sensorium scans from orbit suggest a dry \nclimate, fertile despite its low rainfall. The terrain is mainly \nvegetation-rich mesas and sweeping, uncultivated expanses of \ngrassland. Wildlife tends towards reptilian creatures, and the \npopulation is fairly evenly dispersed in small settlements across \nthe main continents.\nLan is accustomed to having to persuade the Deathwatch to \nperform deeds slightly outside their mandate. He answers the \nBattle-Brothers’ questions with infinite patience, continuing to \nemphasise the need for better relations with the Aurans. When \nthe Kill-team communicates their assent (in as short or long \na time period as they desire), he thanks them graciously. The \nCrusade has tasked him with transporting them, and he informs \nthem that his ship, the Horizon’s Pride, awaits their departure.\narMing, oBjeCtiveS, and oath-taking\nMost of this Mission’s Primary Objectives are clear from the \nbeginning. The Watch Captain covers these (below) explicitly \nwith the Kill-team, and you should do the same with your \nplayers. Other Objectives do not become clear until the Kill-\nteam arrives and discovers what the Aurans have tried so hard to \nhide; the complete list of objectives can be found at the end of \nthe adventure. The Mission has a suggested Requisition rating of \n55 (rounded up from 51), based on the following assumptions:\n•Primary Objective: Discover what is committing the \nmurders on Aurum (Novice Objective, 16 Requisition)\n•Primary Objective: Eliminate the threat on Aurum \n(Skilled Objective, 17 Requisition)\n•Primary Objective: Convince the Aurans to re-assimilate \ninto the Imperium (Veteran Objective, 18 Requisition)\nThe GM may wish to modify the Rating based on how \npessimistic the Kill-team’s Watch Captain is about the threat \nthey face, or how he views the peace-keeping request of   \nthe Crusade. \nTHE HORIzON’S PRIDE\nThe Horizon’s Pride is a glimmering light cruiser. Over the \ncenturies, the Lan dynasty covered its many battle scars with \ncopper laurels. The burnished leaves now virtually encrust \nthe ship; the metal garden testifies to the ship’s endurance. \nThe Horizon’s interior is equally elaborate, although its \nornamentation has not fared as well in the weathering \neffects of a shipboard atmosphere recycled for centuries. \nThe Lan family crest—a rapier and a broken quill—features \nprominently in the engravings. The crew wear uniforms \nstrongly reminiscent of the Imperial Navy, and move with \nan uncanny symmetry that can almost be explained by long \nhours of formation drilling.  \nThe grand scale of the vaulted corridors and ceilings \neasily accommodates armoured Battle-Brothers. Lan offers \neach Battle-Brother a lavishly appointed state room for the \nduration of the journey. If they inquire about something less \nluxuriant, Lan replies that the barracks are all occupied by \nhis crew, and that while more grandiose accommodations are \navailable, the only remaining quarters are cells in the brig. \nproMinent loCationS\nThe Horizon’s Pride is a massive vessel with a crew numbering \ntens of thousands. Some of the locations most likely to be of \ninterest to the Battle-Brothers are detailed below.\nStaterooms\nEach Battle-Brother is offered a stateroom befitting the \ndignitaries and high-ranking military personnel the ship often \ntransports. More gleaming copper laurels trim the rooms of \nthe decadent suites, and each one is carpeted with unique \nand exotic weaves. Most of the furniture is too dainty for a \nSpace Marine, but the ostentatiously large canopy beds can \naccommodate even a Battle-Brother if he chooses to sink into \nthe thick velvet covers.\ncommand Bridge \nThe Command Bridge is without a doubt the most elaborately \nbedecked vista on the Horizon’s Pride. Sturdy glass panels \ndepicting stellar bodies alternate with ancient cogitators and \nsensorium reporters. Every luminator is held aloft by a lifelike \nstatue, and the eye can travel no more than a few centimetres \nwithout encountering some surface inlaid with precious stone \nor metal. The command throne sits recessed in the rear wall \nwith an arch of cherubs carved above it. \nLan’s Study\nLan’s study is mercifully free of excess decoration. Its panels \nof strange amber wood emit a soft glow that bathes the room. \nAcross from his desk is the room’s centrepiece: a bas relief in \nmarbled metal depicting a swirl of geometric shapes.\nAdjoining the study is his library, full of rare tomes \ntowering to the ceiling and even rarer alien artefacts in glass \ncases. The items on display in the library are harmless, the \ntype of novelties tolerated in the hands of those who can \nafford them: a Jokaero digital laser, a wraithbone pendant, an \nork tooth, and other similar trophies.\nThe Brig\nIf any of the Battle-Brothers opts for more austere \naccommodations, Lan is as good as his word. Upon request, \nhe makes available several unlocked cells in the prison block. \nThese tiny, unadorned rooms are not dissimilar from the \nBattle-Brothers’ personal quarters on Watch Fortress Erioch. \nHowever, while their cells are solid and private, there are less \ncomfortable holdings deeper in the brig. There, greasy runoff \nfrom the engine rooms above drips through stacked cages \nwhere less illustrious prisoners languish. One such prisoner \nis Kohl Bennex (see below), who pleads with the Battle-\nBrothers to hear his tale if they ever enter the block.\n12\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nperSonS of intereSt\nThe bulk of the Horizon’s crew step around the Kill-team \nand politely avoid eye contact with the practiced ease of the \nserf classes. However, certain crew and passengers are more \nnoteworthy.\nVeyoris Akioh\nLan’s Seneschal handles the ship’s most important matters \nof commerce and information brokering. Most of the senior \ncommand circle seems accustomed to the presence of Adeptus \nAstartes—not surprising given Lan’s appointment as the \nDeathwatch liaison. Akioh is the exception. He consistently finds \nexcuses to avoid their path, to leave any location they arrive in, \nand to interact with them as little as possible. \nIn truth, Akioh is an unsanctioned psyker. His skill in telepathy \nmakes him exceptional at his job aboard the Horizon’s Pride, and \nso Lan fastidiously does not question his Seneschal’s prescient \nflashes of insight into people and events. A deeply religious man, \nAkioh is not certain that the Emperor’s holy warriors aren’t able \nto see straight through to the warp taint in his soul. He thus \nminimises contact whenever Deathwatch representatives are on \nboard, particularly if they include a Librarian.\nIf cornered into conversation, he is polite but obviously \nnervous. He attempts to stick to simple topics of mutual \ninterest, such as war tactics or the progress on the Crusade \nsalients. Should Akioh’s secret be realised, he penitently submits \nhimself to judgment, vowing that no one aboard the ship knew   \nhis secret.\nAlthea ciberis\nAlthea Ciberis would not be picked out of a crew line-up \nas Lan’s First Officer, but it is her role nonetheless. This \nwithered old woman possesses a fierce determination and \neven fiercer tongue. She began as an auspex operator on the \nHorizon when it was still captained by Diaz’s great-uncle on \nthe far side of the warp gate. She has survived and served \nthree generations of the Lan family, which she idolises.\nAlthea is thoroughly hardened by her long years in the \nvoid as well as the last four decades of the Crusade. She has \nlittle patience and no fear—of Space Marines or anyone \nelse. Virtually the only person she shows any respect to is \nthe captain. If she suspects (or sees) that the Battle-Brothers \nare causing any sort of inconvenience for Lan, she does not \nhesitate to seek them out for a reprimand.\nArchibal Heth\nBrigadier Archibal Heth is not a part of the Horizon’s crew. \nHe is also a passenger bound for Aurum and bears a purpose \nsimilar to the Battle-Brothers. Heth recently inherited the \nunenviable post of Ambassador-Militant to Aurum. This tasks \nhim with both commanding the tiny force of Imperial troops \npermitted in Haistand and—the reason for sending a senior \nofficer—continuing negotiations with the natives.\nHeth is greatly relieved that the Deathwatch agreed to \ninvolve themselves on the planet. As a veteran of the Acheros \nsalient, he has seen the might of the Adeptus Astartes \nfirsthand. The Brigadier’s face is lined from the strain of the \nwar with Chaos, and he wears a monocle. His personal effects \ncontain a great variety of weapons, but on the ship he makes \ndo with a standard laspistol. \nWhile he has never been to Aurum, Heth has detailed \nintelligence from the Crusade’s long history with the planet. \nHe is more than willing to tell the Battle-Brothers everything \nhe knows about the politics, prominent people, and geograph \nof Haistand.\nKohl Bennex\nKohl Bennex’s term of service aboard Lan’s ship was short-\nlived. He stands accused of slaying an Enginseer in the servitor \nbay. While Lan would be well within his rights to execute \nBennex, he opted to hold him until he could rendezvous \nwith representatives of the Adeptus Mechanicus and turn the \ncriminal over. \nBennex has good reason to fear the Machine Cult’s justice, \nand takes any opportunity to convince the Battle-Brothers to \nplead his case. According to Bennex, he did kill Enginseer Kreth, \nbut it was in self defence. The young crewman encountered a \nscullion servitor behaving erratically and repeating nonsense \nphrases. He brought it to the Enginseer for examination. When \nhe explained the situation, Kreth suddenly attempted to impale \nhim with his utility mechadrendite. Bennex managed to dodge \nthe strike, and in a panic, knocked the tech-adept into an open \nvat of caustic engine waste.\nIf the Battle-Brothers meet and believe Bennex, they could \nreact in numerous ways. Lan did not look deeply into the matter, \ntoo worried about a potential Machine Cult reprisal for the \ndeath of one of their own. However, he places great weight on \nthe opinions of the Battle-Brothers, and heeds any reasonable \nadvice they give. Should the Kill-team choose to investigate the \nservitors, the defiled automatons erupt into violence, launching \nthe corrupted servitors encounter (see page 14).\ndiaz lan\nDiaz Lan is a member of the Lan Rogue Trader Dynasty, \nwhich sent many vessels through with the Achilus \nCrusade. A far better diplomat than the Crusade’s busy \nLord Militant, Diaz Lan was nominated to the position \nof Crusade liaison, and is often the voice of requests \nfrom the Crusade and Lord Militant Tetrarchus himself. \nIf any of the Battle-Brothers have served long terms \nin the Deathwatch, they will probably have had prior \nencounters with Lan.\n13\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\ncaptain Diaz Lan\nLan generally gives the Kill-team space, although he makes \na point to cross their paths a few times during the journey \nto enquire about previous Missions. He may invite them for \na social dinner as an excuse to sate his ever-curious mind, \nor hold a casual discussion aboard the bridge. However, \nhe avoids bringing them into his study and library if at all \npossible. If they seek him out there, a successful Scrutiny \nTest detects an undercurrent of nervousness in his gracious \ndemeanour. If pressed, he professes to be worried about the \nsafety of his many rare artefacts, as his display areas were not \nsized for giants. In truth, it is not the items on display that \nworry him, but those he has secreted away.\noptional enCounter: \nCorrupted ServitorS\nIf the group is one that enjoys action, some players might \nbe ready to deal a little of the Emperor’s vengeance before \ntheir journey on the Horizon is over. Kohl Bennex’s story is \nindeed true. Enginseer Kreth was an infiltrator from Samech, \nsent to sabotage the next intervention on Aurum to give the \napostate magi more time for their endeavours. Kreth spent \nseveral months working dark rituals and incorporating tainted \ncircuitry into any servitor he could get hold of. The subtle \ntech-sorcery sleeps inert until activated, which allowed Kreth \nto infect a great number without detection. He had planned to \nunleash them on the delegation mid-journey. Even though the \nsaboteur is dead, the malicious programs he wrote will not lie \ndormant much longer. If Battle-Brothers do not discover the \nservitors first, the creatures wake and attack on their own.\nIf the GM decides to use this encounter, he can drop hints \nof the impending danger in addition to the plight of Bennex. \nWhile describing general activity on the ship, mention that the \nservitors seem in poor repair. Their movement is twitchy; their \nflesh is marred by un-sutured wounds; they may occasionally \nwander the corridors to no apparent purpose as though their \ncommand programming has become corrupt.\nUnless the Battle-Brothers have pressed the matter to an \nearly conclusion, the servitor attack comes when the Kill-team \nis separated, such as when they rest. A pair of the deranged \nautomatons attacks each Battle-Brother. It is immediately \nobvious that something is very wrong with the creatures the \ninstant they come into view. Their dead pores seep a brackish, \nfoul-smelling liquid, and a faint orange glow shines in their eye \nsockets. The servitors mutter a constant stream of blasphemous \nsyllables (which continues for some minutes even after they \nare put down unless all vocal capability is destroyed). Equally \ndisturbing is the mutated state of their limbs. Whether their \nappendages previously ended in hands or tools, each one \nis now a deadly spray of razor-like metal fragments. These \njagged bouquets dance with baleful energy. \nBrigadier Heth has his stateroom in the same area as those \noffered to the Kill-team. Anyone nearby may hear the sounds \nof las fire coming from his room, and realise that he too is \nunder attack.\nAs the combat winds down, Diaz Lan comes barreling \ndown the corridor, silk robe spattered with blood and lubricant \nand his fine bolt pistols smoking. “Never a dull moment \nwith the Deathwatch!” Lan exclaims, surveying the area for \nany lingering monstrosities. Satisfied, he starts to make his \nhabitual gesture of holstering his pistols, only to realise that \nhe is hardly dressed for the occasion. He sighs in disgust at \nhis ruined robe. “Well, I suppose I’d better have the rest of the \nservitor pool checked. I’m sure you gentlemen can take care of \nyourselves. Pardon me.”\nThe crew spend the duration of the voyage herding \nservitors in for detailed diagnostics by the ship’s most senior \nand trusted tech-priests.\nthe SeCret life of diaz lan\nServing as the Crusade’s errand boy is far from ambitious Diaz Lan’s first choice of occupation. An explorer by heart, he has had \nto content that wanderlust for many decades by gathering the second-hand tales and trophies of others. The small museum in \nhis library is but the tip of an iceberg. He has secreted away dozens of artefacts, weapons, and documents that would raise many \neyebrows if they came to light. While Lan’s status as a Rogue Trader affords him a great deal of leeway in his possessions and \ninterests, the Crusade’s forces contain enough steadfast puritans that discretion is in his best interests. \nLan is a scholar and collector, not a sympathiser with the alien’s cause. Even if he could power his Helix Gauntlet, he has no \nmore intention of wielding it than he does of converting to the Tau Empire. The Battle-Brothers present an enticing risk for \nLan. They might be pragmatic individuals with whom he could finally share enlightened conversation. Or they could condemn \nhim as a xenos sympathiser and trader of forbidden items. If any of the Battle-Brothers make a good impression on the Rogue \nTrader, he may launch an exploratory philosophical conversation about alien lore to see how much it is safe to reveal. Should \nany of the characters win Lan’s trust, he proves to be a highly knowledgeable resource about the secrets of the Jericho Reach. A \nfew of his hidden possessions include:\n•Journal of Balastus Irem: This text, detailing the mentalities, commerce, and trade etiquette of several alien races was banned \nby the Ordo Xenos when they purged the entire Irem family line in the Koronus Expanse.\n•Helix Gauntlet: Detailed twin spirals wrap this sleek and perfectly seamless silver gauntlet. A loose power socket near the \nwrist suggests that the glove might serve as a weapon if powered, but Lan has never found a compatible energy source. This \nitem is locked in a chest in the Rogue Trader’s private quarters.\n•Sarcophagus of the Honoured Dead: The relief in Lan’s study is actually the lid of one of the coveted artefacts rumoured to \ncontain the Honoured Dead. These ornate coffins trade for fabulous prices in the Jericho Reach. A switch underneath Lan’s \ndesk dislodges the sarcophagus from the wall. \n14\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe Golden \nPlanet\n“Behind every smile, there hides treachery. \nBeneath every pillow, there lies a dagger. \nWithin every flowing cup, there waits poison.”\n–from the Psalms of Suspicion \nT\nhe trip to Aurum takes close to a month. Even as \ncharted by a Navigator, the route from Erioch to Aurum \nrequires detours and frequent re-calculations because \nof the presence of the Hadex Anomaly. When the ship at last \nmakes its final translation into real space, Lan sees Brigadier \nHeth and the Battle-Brothers off. He does not accompany \nthem in the lander to the surface. As he explains it:\n“I fear I’ve worn out my welcome with the Aurans. You know \nthat particular sour look your Watch Captain gets whenever \nI darken your threshold? That expectation that his patience is \nabout to be tried? It’s rather the same look Caele Darkscourge \ngets when he sees me. Your Mission will go better without my \naid, rest assured.”\nAs the lander descends, read aloud or paraphrase the \nfollowing:\nAurum is true to its namesake. The atmosphere is a soft gold as \nyou descend through it. The shuttle speeds over sandy plateaus \nwrapped in leafy vines before Haistand comes into view. The \ntribal capital towers on the border between the planet’s canyon \nsavannahs and its fertile mesas. Haistand rests on the flat top \nof a great cliff, where time has tightly packed more stone and \nwood structures into the same space. A wide road winds up the \ncliff-side to accommodate a steady stream of natives from the  \noutlying lands.\nThe Warp MosT perilous\nPlotting a course through warp space is a difficult task \nunder the best of conditions. Even with their genetic \ngifts, Navigators must train for years to guide ships \nsafely through the Empyrean. Even then, they would be \nlost without the guiding light of the Astronomican. The \nHadex Anomaly—a cancerous rift in realspace where \nthe warp and reality mingle—festers in the centre of \nthe Jericho Reach. The warp in and around the vortex is \nthe domain of some of Chaos’s most dreadful minions, \nand so blighted is the region that the Astronomican \nis often obscured. For both these reasons, all but the \nmost desperate and insane void-farers give the Hadex \nAnomaly a wide berth even if avoiding it means they \nmust take a more indirect route.\n15\nFrom the Journal of Balastus Irem\n598412.M41\nA Strategic Withdrawal\nI have seen a great many terrors during my years in the shadows of the Expanse. I daresay some I wilfully sought out. Yet never \ndid I think to face the mythic nightmares upon which the Imperium’s history is founded. In my last entry of the promising sites here \nin the Unbeholden Reaches, I detailed uninhabited Anomaly 47-M. It may have no denizens, but it is far from free of competition. I \ntook a dozen of my best men into those dead halls. When we began to notice other footprints in the dust, we assumed it must be our old \ncompetitors for the Expanse’s treasures: the Disciples of Thule.\nHow wrong we were.\nHow can words describe the soul-freezing dread of suddenly stumbling upon a horror you only half believed in? I know now that corrupted \nAdeptus Astartes really do exist, and they are more terrible than imagination could ever conjure. They effortlessly slaughtered my \nmen with their weapons roaring like ravenous beasts. It was only through the sacrifice of dutiful Vega that I managed to flee back to the \nship in time for us to escape. I have few doubts that if those warriors of damnation had breached our hull, they could have slaughtered \nus to a man.\nFrom whence did they come? I have never heard so much as a rumour of their kind in the Koronus Expanse before now. They seemed to \nbe searching for something upon the Anomaly. Let them have it. Emperor preserve anyone who hopes to prevent them from taking it.\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe shuttle sets down in a wide circle where the rich \nbrown soil is exposed. This primitive landing pad at the edge \nof town is the only accommodation made for off-worlders. \nTwo other crafts with Imperial markings also sit here, empty. \nAbove them, the bustling city awaits.\nTHE cITY OF HAISTAND\nHaistand was founded far back in the planet’s history as a place \nfor trade between the nomadic tribes of the savannah and the \ntribes living permanently in the green canyons. As the tribes \nbegan to unite into larger groups, Haistand turned into a centre of \ntrade and politics. Millennia later, Aurans still look every inch the \npart of a warrior people. They stand taller than average humans \nby nearly a head, and their bronze-skinned bodies are lean and \nfit. They mastered agriculture several centuries ago, but combat \nprowess is still essential for survival and is a skill that their culture \nvalues highly.\nSimilarly, their goods and clothing still follow the traditions of \ntheir predatory ancestors. Common Auran garments are cut from \nskins and hides, while interlaced reptile scales form the common \nbasis for armour; their implements of crafting and war are largely \nbone. Most of the planet’s fauna is reptilian, including the unusual \nsaurian strain dubbed midasaurs. These creatures have incredibly \nresilient scales that glitter with streaks of gold in Aurum’s \nsunlight. The primary herd animal is the argrax, a slightly less \ntemperamental strain of grox whose larger relatives remain wild \non the plains, and are often hunted for food. The primary mount \nand beast of burden is a sleek bipedal lizard called a theratryx.\nThe Auran reaction to the Space Marines varies. Here their \niconic power armour is not a legendary profile, but a point of \ncuriosity. Natives of all ages and genders show an obvious interest \nin this new breed of off-worlder, but no fear. Haistand’s buildings \nare mostly of primitive but sturdy masonry, and their ceilings \nare high enough to accommodate most Space Marines because \nof the natives’ natural height. Residences and shops crowd each \nother and the busy streets, which throng with carts, livestock, and \npedestrians.\nthe Snaking aSCent\nThe road hewn into the cliff that Haistand rests atop is wider \nthan any street to be found in the city. It sees a steady flow of \ntraffic from sunrise to sunset, and must accommodate caravans \nof traders and argrax herds being driven to and from market. It \ntakes approximately 30 minutes to climb the zigzagging path \nto the city hundreds of metres above. Two ancient columns \nmark the entrance to Haistand, taller than any structure in \nthe city. These remnants of the planet’s lost ancestry each \nbear a single eagle. It is here that Brigadier Heth parts ways \nwith the Battle-Brothers, telling them he can be found at the \nAspirance, the local Imperial Guard barracks.\nOptional Encounter: Spooking the Herd\nTo say that argrax are less temperamental than grox is like saying \nthat Ork Mekboyz are smarter than standard Boyz: it may be \ntrue, but it is still relative. Many rangers drive their argrax herds \nup the winding road to Haistand for trade. While these beasts \nare more accustomed to one another than their cousins, they are \nstill difficult to keep under control under the best circumstances. \nSide by side with giants in imposing power armour is not the best \ncircumstances.\nMidway through the climb, the Battle-Brothers pass a slow-\nmoving group of argrax. A middle-aged Auran prods them along \nwith a whip and spear, sending the lash in the direction of any \nreptile that stops moving or makes aggressive motions. As the \nSpace Marines go by, one of the creatures raises its snout and \nsniffs the air. Something about the scent of these metal-clad men \nand the hum of their power units offends the beast. It lets out \na shrieking roar. The ranger’s whip cracks mightily against the \nscaled hide, but it is too late. The other reptiles pick up the cry. \nThe herd erupts into violence.\nMost of the creatures attack the source of their provocation: \nthe Battle-Brothers. However, a few others leap on the general \npopulace, turning the winding road into pandemonium. The \nAurans are a warrior society and by and large can defend \nthemselves from angry livestock. The GM may just describe the \nnatives’ skirmishes as scenery to the Kill-team’s own fight, or he \nmay wish to offer the Battle-Brothers opportunities for heroism \namidst the chaos such as:\n•A small child with a beast bearing down on it.\n•A brave Auran warrior surrounded by a ring \nof   the creatures.\n•An agrax charging into a crowd or wagon near the path’s \nedge—almost certain to topple someone off the edge \nthrough sheer velocity and body weight.\n16\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nplanetary datafax: auruM\nPopulation: Estimated 2 Billion\nTithe Grade: Exactus Non\nSpecial Notation: Undergoing integration into the Imperium vis the Achilus \nCrusade\nGeography/Demography: Hot/Temperate, abiding planetary climate is \ntropical with a low degree of precipitation and storm activity. The planet has \ntwo main continental landmasses. Each are dominated by arid plains and rain \nforest zones surrounding a chain of large mountain ranges. The equatorial \nregions are made up of bands of deserts. The planet also possesses relatively \nsmall polar oceans.\nGovernmental Type: Indigenous Monarchy (reigning ruler is known as \n“The Caele”)\nPlanetary Governor: Not yet determined\nAdept Presence: Initial/Low; the Ecclesiarchy and Imperial Guard have small stations set up on the planet’s main \ncontinent.\nMilitary: The Aurum tribes have a primitive force of infantry and cavalry (roughly two regiments of each), nominally \ncommanded by the Caele.\nTrade/Economy/Addendum: Aurum is rich in promethium deposits and the rare decavane crystals (see below). In \naddition to its abundant natural resources, the planet is strategically well-suited to the needs of the Crusade and the \nAurum tribes themselves are a fierce warrior culture that is nearly ideal for integration into the Imperial Guard.\nthe golden BleSSing\nAurum derives its name from the golden glow that suffuses its atmosphere. If it contained so mundane a resource as \nactual gold ore, it would be of interest only to reckless Rogue Traders willing to risk the untamed Jericho Reach to \nexploit it. However, Aurum is rich in a far rarer and more immediately useful resource than metal. The unique amber \ncolour suffusing the sky and tinting the planet originates from its rare Decavane crystals. Decavane crystals can hold an \nexponentially larger charge than standard crystal batteries, making them highly valued for alternate weapon patterns \nand other military equipment. \nThe relationship between the crystals and Aurum’s environment, if any, is unclear, but it is obvious the planet is \nexceptionally resource-rich and fertile. Nearly every form of flora prospers when introduced to the rich soil, and herd \nanimals mature quickly and free of illness. Even the native population has grown strong and able on this unusually \nhealthy planet, although the native predators are equally flourishing and the Aurans must strive constantly to perfect \ntheir martial skills to keep pace with them.) Some have theorised that the Decavane crystals emit a subtle, beneficial \nenergy field, while others propose that they are the effect and not the cause of some undiscovered property of the planet. \nUntil the natives allow the Adeptus Mechanicus to perform detailed research, scholars can only conjecture.\niMperial rootS\nFor their part, the Aurans attribute their planet’s benevolence to the “Soul of Aurum,” a male personification of the \nplanet’s will. This Soul actually has striking similarities to the God-Emperor—from his creation of 20 sons and their \narmies to a betrayal by his most beloved child. Their religious parables likewise show roots in the Imperial Creed. The \noriginal date of human habitation can only be guessed at, but the low gothic dialect and various cultural artefacts clearly \nindicate an Imperial history. \nCulture\nCombat is an Auran way of life, encompassing all ages and genders. In the planet’s past, scattered tribes warred for \ndominance. The tribes have been united for several centuries, but the planet’s predators ensure that martial prowess \nremains a necessity. As a result, while the Aurans do farm the fertile land and raise herd animals, traditional hunts \nremains a staple of their culture. The society has not yet developed currency; they rely on a barter system.\nThe traditional Auran greeting is to touch one’s weapon’s hilt to the other party’s shoulder. Non-lethal martial \nchallenges are used to solve nearly any disagreement, from domestic quarrels to trade disputes. If a matter escalates to \na serious grudge, the natives have a tradition called “splitting the rock of grievance.” (See page 27 for more details on \nthis combat ritual).\nAurum’s plains make wood an uncommon commodity, and it is unclear if metal ore even exists on the planet. The \nnatives show a relatively advanced understanding of farming and medicine, but their implements tend to be made of \nrock and bone.\n17\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nthe overlook\nThe buildings closest to the city entrance are residences, stacked \ntwo or even a perilous three stories high. The buildings along \nthe outer perimeter are riddled with windows—some open \nand some curtained by animal hides. This section of Haistand \nis home to many of the city’s tradesmen and guards, as well as \nproviding temporary lodging for local travellers.\nthe word of faith\nThe Word of Faith is the first and only Imperial mission on \nAurum. The dead Sister Rachayel served here, protecting its \nchief missionary, Father Marius. The building is not much to \nlook at: a converted single story residence with a meticulously \nmaintained Aquila painted above the door. Should the Battle-\nBrothers venture in sight of the mission, they witness firsthand \nthe difficult task the Ecclesiarchy has before them. Father \nMarius stands on the steps, doing his best to minister to the \ndisdainful populace. Read aloud or paraphrase the following:\n A gaunt, balding man in worn Ecclesiarchy robes stands outside \nthe mission. He holds a worn copy of the Imperial Creed in \none hand as three Aurans tower over him wearing mocking \nexpressions. One of the young men makes a half-hearted grab for \nthe book. “Why would a real god need his stories saved in your \nsee-speak?” The missionary narrowly avoids the first Auran but \nalmost backs into another. The second one leans in “Why does \nhe use frail old men to spread his name? If your Emperor is so \nmighty, why don’t real warriors follow him?”\nIt is at that moment the missionary catches sight of you. \nHis eyes alight with hope, as though the Emperor himself has \njust answered his prayers. He straightens his posture and points \ndefiantly towards you. “Here, here is your answer! I have told \nyour disbelieving ears that the Emperor protects, and the proof \nstands before you. These men are his holy champions, and the \nmightiest warriors in the galaxy.”\nThe sudden appearance of such imposing off-worlders \ncombined with Father Marius’s speech is enough to startle even \nthe bold natives into a lapse of silence. The Battle-Brothers are \nfree to try to help Marius correct the Aurans’ views with the \nappropriate Interaction Tests, or ignore them altogether. (In \nthe latter case, they quickly leave.)\nMarius has been in Haistand for many years, and can offer \na great deal of insight into the city, the people, and their \nleader—Rylus Darkscourge. He can also relate the details of \nSister Rachayel’s death. He was the one who found the sister’s \nbody here in the Word of Faith, by an altar to Saint Dominica. \nThe body has since been returned to her order for final rites. \nRachayel bore great suspicion towards the faithless of Aurum. \nTowards the end of her life, she had begun to suspect that they \nwere hiding a dark secret. She confided to Father Marius that \nshe sometimes saw flames dancing on the western horizon and \nsmall convoys of men setting out from Haistand through its \nback gates in the dead of night—always heading north.\nRachael thought the recent deaths were the work of a \ndaemon, and spent many nights searching for it. Marius is not \nsure whether he believes her assertion or not, but he cannot \ndeny that she must have encountered something dreadful \nduring the midnight hunts. He does not believe she would \nhave been so cowardly as to kill herself, even in the face \nof a daemon. Marius knows she ranged at least to the cliffs \nbeneath Haistand and the surrounding lands, but says she \nwas sometimes gone days at a time, so her search may have \nextended further. The last time he saw her alive, she had been \nplanning to follow the next suspicious train of wagons north.\nthe old religion\nNot far from the Word of Faith stands a much older site \nof worship. This nameless temple is a stark contrast to the \nstruggling mission. It dates back to Haistand’s founding, \nrepresenting the native religion. If the Auran’s command of \nlow gothic was not evidence enough that they must once have \nbeen under the Imperium’s banner, the tribal altar erases any \ndoubt. The frieze above the entrance features a weathered line \nof carved warriors. The spacing suggests that once the figures \nnumbered twenty, although two of them have been defaced \ninto only vague outlines. The warriors bear such distinctive \nfeatures as a cyclopean eye on one and wings on another. \nIf the Battle-Brothers enter the temple, they see a dozen or \nso Aurans in quiet prayer, with no apparent priest. One wall \ndisplays a well-maintained mural of a golden hero wrestling \na four-headed dragon.\nauran arMS and arMour\nAurum is abundant in many resources, but metal ore \nis not among them. Even such rudimentary metals \nas bronze and iron were unknown to them until the \nCrusade’s arrival. The Aurans’ saurian scale armour and \nbone weapons certainly fit the definition of primitive \nweapons. However, the evolution of the planet’s wild \nlife makes many of its derivative materials stronger \nthan the analogue on most primitive worlds. Midasaur \nscale armour is so strong that it confers the same \nprotection as standard flak armour. The prevalent bone \nweapons hold a better edge than most feral blades, \nbut still have difficulty penetrating strong materials. \nSince that includes midasaur scale armour, the finest \nlocal weapons are crafted from razor sharp talons or   \nfangs instead. \nThe Battle-Brothers may also notice an unusual \nweapon carried by many of the planet’s warriors. The \ngyrblade is a set of two crescent-shaped cutting edges \nat a 120 degree angle from one another. Their axis is a \njointed handle which allows the wielder to quickly vary \ntheir attack angle. Skilled specialists in the weapon \nare also capable of rotating the blades in a constant \ncircular motion, creating a deadly zone of lacerating \nmotion around the axis. They are used singly and in \npairs. Profiles for gyrblades and other common Auran \ntools of war can be found on page 28.\n18\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nwar groundS\nThe war grounds were constructed to rally vast numbers \nof troops from the planet’s diverse tribes in wartime. The \nestablishments of Haistand’s most renowned armourers ring \nthe district. At present the grounds are an expanse of open \nground in the packed city. The city protectorate who practice \nhere occupy only a minute fraction of the total area, and \npatches of grass have crept onto the cleared earth with no \nfeet to trample it.\nThe sparring warriors give the Battle-Brothers curious \nglances before quickly and deliberately ignoring them, \navoiding eye contact as best one can with a Space Marine \nhelmet. If the Battle-Brothers approach, the Aurans do not \nacknowledge them until directly or addressed. When this \nhappens, Shieldmaster Zayr takes over the discussion. He steps \nto the front of the group and replies to the Kill-team with \ncurt responses and a hostile gaze. His answers are uniformly \nunhelpful, obviously meant to discourage further conversation. \nIn particular if the topic of Sister Rachayel or the other killings \ncomes up, Zayr resolutely maintains that the Imperial regime \nis simply over-reacting to the planet’s violent predators. His \nwords and attitude convey a sense that the Imperium is not \nmentally equipped to deal with the danger of life on Aurum. \nThe Aspirance\nThe dozen Imperial Guardsmen tolerated on Haistand have \ndubbed the two-story structure afforded them for barracks and \nadministration the Aspirance. The stone building sits on a corner \nof the war grounds, where their members are permitted to drill \n(usually openly scrutinized by the natives). The Aspirance is \nBrigadier Heth’s headquarters. If the Battle-Brothers seek him \nout, they find him settling in behind a cramped desk on the \nfirst floor, sorting through the records left by his predecessor. \nAccording the guardsmen’s accounts, the previous assignee \nto the post slighted one of the nearby native warriors with a \ncareless remark. He compounded the mistake by accepting the \nresulting challenge to battle—with lethal results.\nHeth offers to help the Battle-Brothers however he can. \nSome of his men have been stationed on Aurum for decades; \nthey freely describe their experiences and answer questions. \nWhile the militia at the war grounds has never been friendly \nwith the occupants of the Aspirance, mutual respect was \nburgeoning until mutilated bodies began appearing. Since \nthen, the relationship has been curt and guarded. If asked \nabout the Caele, one of the guardsmen says the following:\n“I’ve seen Caele Darkscourge up close a few times. He used to \ncome to the Aspirance to talk to the Brigadier—the old one. \nWhen you meet him, you’ll certainly see why they follow the \nman. You just know he’s sure he’s doing the right thing—or I \nguess that’s what the Aurans think, I mean. He doesn’t look at \nus like the rest of ‘em do though. Most of them just seem to be \nlaughing on the inside. But when he looks at us, you can tell he’s \nsearching for something, and seeing something the others aren’t. I \nthink I like it better when they laugh.”\nThey have also witnessed the same strange occurrences that \nSister Rachayel reported. One of the soldiers speaks of winds \nfrom north sometimes carrying an odour that he cannot quite \nidentify, but associates with industry and hive worlds. Many \nof the guardsmen have sometimes seen an odd glow in the \nwestern sky at night, when all should be dark.\nthe hall of viCtorieS\nThe Hall is the largest building in Haistand, and one of the \nfew made entirely of wood. The polished structure is well-\nmaintained, but currently empty. It is only used for the Caele’s \nceremonies. In previous generations, this meant celebrations \nbefore or after battle. However, as the tribes of the planet \nhave made peace, its purpose has evolved to hosting holiday \ncelebrations and feasts for visiting tribal leaders. An empty \nstone amphitheatre stands immediately adjacent to the hall.\nCoMMerCe aiSleS\nThese haphazard rows of carts and baskets are the heart \nof Haistand. The city evolved as a place for the barter \nsociety to meet and trade. The goods exchanging hands are \nrepresentative of the feral worlder’s day-to-day life. Baskets \nof produce and grain from the agricultural mesas crowd the \nnarrow walkways. Bladed weapons are displayed plentifully \nbeside ornaments of bone and glittering gold crystal. Perhaps \nthe most interesting sight is the hanging carcasses of giant, \npredatory lizards several times the size of a man. The skins \ndeCavane CryStalS\nDecavane crystals are more myth than science. Reported \nonly in the Jericho Reach, usually they are found in small \nclutches, often already excavated from tightly guarded \nlocations. The crystals are most valued as concentrated \nenergy sources for various armaments, although rumours \nabound that they have more miraculous properties such \nas healing old wounds and purging illness.\nNo authoritative story exists as to the origin of the \ncrystals. The most prevalent theory connects them to \nEldar terraforming. Others point to their exclusivity in \nthe Jericho Reach as evidence that they must have been \ndeveloped by the civilisation that once dominated the \nJericho Sector before it fell to shadow. More sinister \nwhispers also exist, tales that the crystals are the ill-\nbegotten product of dark pacts made long ago. \nappliCationS\nDecavane Crystals can be fashioned to replace or \naugment the power sources of many standard weapons. \nThis requires sufficient time, tools, and a successful \nTech-Use Test. If the would-be Artificer succeeds, this \ngrants the following benefits to a las or plasma ranged \nweapon, or a Powered melee weapon: Increase Damage \nby +1; the weapon gains the equivalent of the Razor \nSharp Quality. Alternatively, the power source of any \npiece of equipment may be modified, increasing any \ntime limits on its operation by a factor of x10. \n19\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nand freshly butchered meat of various midasaur strains fills \nthe nearby air with the scent of blood.\nOne particular merchant, a relatively short man by the \nname of Beyrr, takes an extreme interest in the Kill-team’s \npower armour if he catches sight of this off-world technology \nmarvel. He waves his hands excitedly to flag them over, and \nif that fails goes as far as to chase after them through the \nstreets. He pleads and bargains for them to trade him their \n“fabulous thinstone armour” (naturally completely ignorant \nof the personal bond between an Adeptus Astartes and his \narmour and their lack of interest in material goods). He offers \nsuch exchanges as a herd of the local lizard livestock, his own \npersonal residence in the overlook, and axes edged with the \ndiamond-hard fangs of a Diablodon. \nWhen all else fails, he makes a more desperate bid. He \nsurreptitiously produces a wrapped object from under his vest. \nWithin the leather folds is a very unusual knife. Its handle is \ncommon carved stone, but the blade is a large, curving talon \nof sleek charcoal black chitin. A successful Challenging \n(+0) Forbidden Lore (Xenos) Test identifies it as Tyranid \nin origin. The merchant swears the blade is extremely rare \nand can cut through anything. He promises four in exchange \nfor one of their suits of armour.\nIf questioned, he is not immediately forthcoming to \nthe source of the weapons. Successful Interaction Tests or \nroleplayed persuasion may convince him to reveal that a man \nnamed Heydal traded the set of talons to him. However, this \nwas many months ago and Heydal does not live in Haistand. \nHe has presumably moved on.\nother reSidenCeS\nWhile homes can be found on nearly every street of Haistand, \nthey are most concentrated at the Overlook near the city’s \nentrance, and at the far side. The opposite end of the city \ncontains many smaller dwellings of the farmers who own or \nwork the local lands. They live within the city for convenience \nand protection, and make the trek down a small network \nof trails on the cliff ’s other side that lead to the fertile   \nfarming canyons.\nthe Caele’S hoMeStead\nThe Caele’s residence sprawls along one of the cliff edges. \nThe main structure is three stories high and ancient, dating \nbeyond the memory of any living Auran. It has a flat roof and \nstriking granite columns at the entrance. Time and the elements \nhave eroded the columns, but large swathes of their original \ninscriptions remain visible. They portray overlapping ellipses, \nangles, and vectors. An Ordinary (+10) Scholastic Lore \n(Astromancy) or Navigation (Stellar) Test recognises the \nimages as star charts of the systems closest to Holy Terra. \nSmaller stone annexes connect to the large house by \ngravel paths. The complex includes a small pen for theratryx \nmounts, and a large garden of hanging plants. A few warriors \ncome and go from the main building, but they seem to be on \nerrands more than patrol.\nalkedre fireStalker\nAlkedre is Rylus’s Sinsar, his second in command. While \nAuran leadership does not have a formal line of succession, \nthe role of Sinsar assures that the combat trials used to choose \na new Caele can at least be postponed if the current leader \ndies in wartime. Alkedre comes from a distant tribe in the \nfoothills, where Rylus recruited her. She carries a giant two-\nhanded sword and wears bright red armour; more of the same \ncreature’s scales hang in her blond hair. \nUnlike Rylus, Alkedre would welcome an alliance with the \nImperium. She sees it as an opportunity to improve Auran \ntechnology while allowing her people to see other stars \nand learn the battle techniques of other cultures. She voices \nthis opinion quite frequently. However, the Sinsar has great \nrespect for Rylus and while she has no qualms arguing about \nhis decision whenever the opportunity presents itself, she \naccepts his leadership without bitterness.\nkarthaS\nKarthas served for many years as one of Grensvayl’s perimeter \nguards. Two years ago, he suffered a serious bite wound from \na Malissector, and still bears the scars on his shoulder. He \nreturned home to Haistand to heal. After he recovered, instead \nof going back, he took up responsibility for the labour camp \nthat supplies promethium to the quarantined town. The \nguards use it to maintain a great perimeter of fire around the \ntainted valley. He and Zayr are co-conspirators. Zayr is in \ncharge of judging and detaining true criminals, while Karthas \ntransports them and safeguards the secrecy of their location.\nThe true situation is more dire than even Caele Rylus \ncan imagine. Karthas was infected by the Genestealer’s Kiss \nin Grensvayl. His play for oversight of the well was quite \ndeliberate. Over time he persuaded Rylus to let him lead a \nsortie into the town to attempt cleansing it. This slaughter was \nnothing but a ruse. He led his entire party into an ambush, \nand used the confusion to help the Broodlord and several of \nzayr\nZayr is the Shieldmaster of Haistand, tasked with \nmaintaining a standing body of warriors to defend \nthe city. The Aurans have few laws. Most disputes are \nsettled between individuals (often violently) with the \nCaele’s word superseding all. In times of peace, their \ndaily duties mainly entail protecting the Caele and \ncarrying out his orders. However, Zayr and his men \noccasionally intervene to deal with truly dangerous or \ndeviant individuals. In recent years a new punishment \nfor Aurum’s criminals has been devised—a secret \nlabour necessary for the planet’s survival.\nZayr knows the truth behind the killings, and \nbelieves acutely that the shame belongs to the Auran \npeople. He also knows that Rylus wishes to keep \nthe matter quiet. Therefore, both his orders and his \nconscience both incline him to block the newcomers \nfrom learning the shame of Grensvayl, and to resent \nthem for prying.\n20\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nits kin escape. The black depths of the labour camp provide \nan ideal place for the brood to breed and grow. So in the wells \nbuilt to keep the Malissectors contained, their numbers grow. \nKarthas uses the Infected Auran Warrior Profile on page 50.\nRylus keeps Karthas close since he is one of the few privy \nto the secret of the Malissectors. When he is not at the well, \nKarthas is frequently as the Caele’s homestead. He is among \nthe handful of warriors selected to guard and council the \nAuran leader. \nMEETING THE cAELE\nIf the Adeptus Astartes request to meet with the Caele, they \nare almost immediately ushered into the homestead complex \nfor an audience. In fact if they do not seek him out, sooner or \nlater he requests a visit from them. Rylus Darkscourge meets \nthe Battle-Brothers in a large, circular chamber of the main \nbuilding. The room has a sand floor and no furniture. It has \nno external windows and instead several wall sconces provide \ntorchlight and give off a faint herbal smoke. Between the \ntorches hang tapestries so faded that their weaves are nothing \nbut mottled gray outlines of men and beasts now. Read aloud \nor paraphrase the following when Rylus joins them:\nCaele Rylus Darkscourge enters from the door opposite the one \nyou came through. He strides towards you with confident grace. \nAs he comes closer you realise that his height is level with most of \nyour brothers. He nods a greeting but does not smile; his dark eyes \nare serious. “Welcome, Adeptus Astartes. I heard that your tribe \nhad come to Aurum. All that I have read of your kind says that \nyou would not be here without purpose. What is it?”\nPresumably the Battle-Brothers broach the subject of the \nsuspected xenos presence, and possibly the Imperium’s attempts \nto return Aurum to humanity’s fold. Rylus is dismissive of \nthe Crusade’s overtures of alliance, saying that the Imperium \nhas yet to prove they have either the capacity or the worth \nto govern the Auran people. If the Kill-team brings up the \npromethium pits (see the Black Depths encounter below) he \nbecomes defensive. “Does its crude nature offend you? We \ncannot all have your technological marvels.” Any remarks about \nthe volume of promethium being drawn in comparison to the \nsmall amount seen in Haistand only earns a reply like:\n“We are quite new to the practices of draining the blood of our land. \nI supposed we are simply not as efficient at it as your people.” \n When the topic of the unexplained deaths comes up, Rylus \nat least does them the courtesy of not blaming local predators. \nInstead, he asks them what they think is the cause. \n21\nCaele Rylus Darkscourge \nRylus Darkscourge has been the Caele of Aurum since it was discovered by the Crusade \nnearly three decades ago. He is tall and powerfully built even for an Auran—standing \nalmost as tall as a Space Marine. His long black hair contains several small braids, \nbut is unadorned except for the polished bone circlet on his brow. Like all of Aurum’s \nleaders, his right to rule did not come through birth, but through victory in combat. \nRylus is a charismatic speaker and a strong warrior. \nAt the Imperium’s first contact, he realised his people’s way of life would never be \nthe same, by the mere fact that they were no longer alone. Since that time he has \nmeticulously gathered lore and stories of the planets and politics beyond his world, \nmaking him far savvier about the Imperium than most of his people. \nHe drew quite a grim conclusion from the stories of traders and from reading between \nthe lines of history books. He is certain that if the Crusade was allowed to absorb \nAurum, the Imperium would ruthlessly exploit both its people and its resources, leaving \nAurum far less than it was. This was not an easy decision for Rylus to reach. As he \nlearned of the galaxy, he came to understand its many threats and knows that the \nImperium may be man’s best defence. The message of the watching Emperor of Mankind and \na humanity united rings true with him. However, he is the proud king of a proud people. \nSubmitting the golden planet to rule by a cruel and unworthy dictator is a shame he \ncannot allow.\nTo him, the Battle-Brothers present a unique opportunity. Rylus has heard legends of \nthe honour and valour of the Adeptus Astartes. Because their Chapters exist outside the \nnormal confines of the Imperium, they might be able to provide him an unbiased warrior’s \nview on how to deal with the Imperium’s hunger for his world. They are also the first \nmembers of the Imperium he believes might be able to win respect in the eyes of his \npeople. If they could prove themselves the equal of Auran warriors, he would finally \nhave an off-world ally to help him understand and purge the Malissectors.\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nNo matter the theory they present—even if they paint \nthe vivid possibility of a planet overrun with Genestealers or \ndevoured by the following Hive Fleet—Rylus remains firm \nin his edict that outsiders may not venture beyond Haistand. \nHe makes it clear that if they attempt to defy this interdiction, \nhe will respond with force—an incident that could quickly \nescalate to war and unfortunate consequences for the Imperials \npresently in Haistand.\n“Even if I wished to grant you an exception to the laws which \nhave governed your emissaries for decades, my people would never \naccept it. Honoured warriors though you may be in your own \nImperium, you are unproven here. No Auran has a voice in our \ncouncils until they are initiated through our rituals. I am told \nyour Brotherhood has similar traditions of choosing, so surely \nyou understand their importance.” His expression, while still \ngrim, betrays a spark of hope. “I will offer you an opportunity \nI have presented no others: undergo a Trial of Proving. Do this, \nand not only will you advance your Imperium in the eyes of my \npeople, but I will then be free to grant you whatever freedoms \nand answers you need in pursuit of the threat which brought \nyou here.”\nThis is the best Rylus can offer. No amount of debate can \npersuade him to give more, and he continues to press the Kill-\nteam to accept his offer if initially refused.\nTHE BLAcK DEPTHS\nMan knows the places he was never meant to go. The fear he feels \nwhen looking within those forbidden depths is the Emperor’s blessing \nto humanity. It is a sacred whisper to turn back before your soul is \nlost. If only men would listen.\n–Inquisitor Zayel: Admonitions Against the Warp\nThe Battle-Brothers may or may not choose to follow up on the \ndescriptions of strange activities to the north (being careful to \navoid detection unless they wish to start an incident by leaving the \ncity). If they stand on the northern edge of Haistand, a successful \nDifficult (–10) Awareness Test allows the acute olfactory senses \nof the Neuroglottis to recognise the tang of promethium in the air. \nOnce scented, if the Battle-Brothers wish to follow it to its source, \nthey may do so with a Challenging (+0) Tracking Test. \nAlternatively, they may wait to see if any of the strange night-\ntime convoys depart northward. Should they make such an \nattempt, long after sunset two carts drawn by theratryx make a slow \njourney down the smaller paths on the rear slopes of Haistand. \nAssuming the Adeptus Astartes have their helmets’ autosenses \navailable, they can easily see that each cart contains four men \nbound with sturdy rope. A Challenging (+0) Perception Test \nrecognises one of the drivers as being one of Zayr’s men from the \nwar grounds. (The other is Karthas.) Following this procession \nwithout detection requires little in the way of stealth, between the \ndark, the rattle of the carts, and the cries of the theratryx.\nferal worldS\nIn keeping with the Administratum’s need to document \nand quantify, standard terminology has evolved to \nbroadly classify the many types of worlds encountered \nin the Imperium. The designation feral world indicates \na planet with a primitive technology base. While \nother traits are common with such cultures, such as \nphysiques evolved for survival and savage traditions, \nthese are not universal (or unique) to feral worlds. \nEven the measure of technology can be subjective, \nas Imperial-controlled feral worlds may often have \nacquired tools and weapons through trade. However, \ntheir understanding and treatment of such items would \nmake most tech-priests shudder to witness. (Hence the \nlifespan of a machine spirit on a feral world tends to be \nas short as that of the planet’s inhabitants.)\nthe MaliSSeCtorS\nThe mutilated corpses are actually the work of \nGenestealers: a deadly four-armed strain of Tyranid \ncapable of turning other species into their dominated \nminions, and hosts for hideous offspring. In many \ncases the dead were simply victims of a Genestealer’s \ningrained drive to kill. However, others—like Sister \nRachayel—forced the creatures into confrontation by \nactively seeking them out.\nThe Genestealer infestation centres in the settlement \nof Grensvayl, about 200 kilometres from Haistand in the \ncanyon farmlands. The first infection was over a decade \nago, giving the brood time to spread through the town’s \npopulation. For most of this period, Haistand remained \nignorant of the infection. However, as Grensvayl fell out \nof contact, Rylus finally sent a war party to determine \nthe cause. The result was disastrous.\nWhile Rylus does not know the Imperium’s name \nfor these xenos predators, he has seen them teeming in \nthe infected settlement. He and those within the circle \nof knowledge have dubbed the creatures Malissectors. \nThey understand that the monsters infect, and worse \nyet enslave, his people. In Auran culture this is a sign \nof impurity in the victims: that their bodies and minds \ncould not resist domination. Rylus and his people see the \ninfestation as their own failing. The Caele has worked \nhard to conceal the Malissectors from the offworlders \nso as not to show weakness to an enemy.\n22\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nEither method leads the Kill-team no more than a dozen \nkilometres north of the city. The scent of promethium grows \nunmistakable, and then overpowering. When the Battle-Brothers \nsee their destination, read aloud or paraphrase the following:\nThe land has been sloping steadily downwards for the last several \nkilometres. Finally, it drops into a lowland of black, bubbling \nrents in the earth. The crude promethium wells up into large \npools. Men with black-stained limbs scoop the promethium into \nbuckets, and carry it across the shaky wooden planks that connect \none uneven piece of solid ground to another.\nUnfortunately the Battle-Brothers have a more \nimmediate concern that investigating this unsophisticated \npromethium well. A wheeling, shrieking ring of reptilian \npredators surrounds the pits. The heat and fumes from the \nraw promethium keeps them from coming too close to the \nlabouring men, but they dive at the incoming carts with sharp \nbeaks and talons. Only the bows of Zayr’s men keep them \nfrom being torn to shreds as they pass through the perimeter, \nand even then one of the shackled prisoners is dragged from \nthe carts and quickly devoured.\nIf the Kill-team plans to get any closer to the large operation \nin the pits, they are going to have to pass through the circle of sky \nreavers. The creatures emit raucous cries as they circle the wells, \nso their sounds of death are unlikely to be of much concern to \nthe Aurans. But bolter fire, the growl of chainblades, or the glow \nof power swords is sure to attract attention. Unless they devise \na clever plan to avoid the winged predators, assume the Battle-\nBrothers are attacked by approximately twice their number of the \ncreatures (see page 50 for their profiles). The sky reavers should be \nrelatively easy to dispatch, but each time someone uses a loud or \nbright weapon (the GM has final say on what these are), Karthas \nshould make a Challenging (+0) Awareness Test to detect the \nintrusion. If he succeeds, he and the seven Auran guards attack the \nKill-team. Karthas has everything to lose if the Battle-Brothers \nleave alive. Two masters—the Broodlord and Rylus—have tasked \nhim with safeguarding this secret location. If he thinks it is \nexposed, violence is his first solution to hide it again.\nThis primitive attempt to draw promethium is a laborious and \ndangerous effort for the Aurans. It may not be immediately clear \nthat the men being unloaded from the carts are criminals, but it \nis evident they don’t want to be here. All of the men drawing \nand hauling the black sludge notably lack weapons. Only Karthas \nand his men are armed; the sky reavers make effective sentries for \nanyone who cannot defend himself, as several outlying piles of \npicked bones attest.\nthe Crude pitS\nThe black, bubbling wells of promethium swelter in random \npools between the rocks. Sulphur, methane, and other heady \ngases waft invisibly into the air, although between their power \narmour and their multi-lungs the Battle-Brothers should have no \ntrouble with the air. However, if they wish to progress further into \nthe lowland, they need to navigate the pitted terrain. The Aurans \nseem to move from one dry rock bed to the next via improvised \nbridges of wooden planks. It is obvious to the eye that these \nbridges are too fragile to hold a Space Marine, much less one in \npower armour. Some options for getting through include:\n• Make the appropriate Strength or Acrobatics Tests to Leap \n(see page 207 of the DeathwatchRulebook) across the \ngaps. The widest distance is 12 metres.\n•The distances can easily be bridged with a Routine (+20) \nPiloting: Personal Test by anyone equipped with a \njump pack.\n•The pools vary widely in temperature, ranging from \nsimply warm to scalding lakes that can cook a man alive. \nA Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test with an auspex or \nequivalent augurs can determine which pools are safe to \nwade through in power armour and which ones would \ncook them like the blast of a meltagun.\nFalling into or erroneously entering a harmful promethium \npit causes 1d10+4 points of Damage, ignoring armour but not \nToughness. Additionally, roll 1d10–4 on the Power Armour \nCritical Effects Table (on page 163 of the Deathwatch\nRulebook) to see if the extreme conditions damage the Battle-\nBrother’s power armour. These effects continue each Round \none is in the pool, although most of them are small and shallow \nenough that a Battle-Brother should be able to wade out in a \nsingle Round.\nadeptuS aStarteS honour\nThe Divested Hunt encounter (see page 27) assumes the \nBattle-Brothers accept Rylus’s challenge to prove their \nworth. What if they see such games as beneath them and \nrefuse to undergo his proving? If that happens, then the \nAurans show them the same disdain (and impose on them \nthe same restrictions) that they have for the rest of the \nImperium. \nRylus is not the only person who knows about the \ninfection at Grensvayl. The Kill-team can eventually \nlearn of the settlement’s plight and location elsewhere in \nHaistand or at the promethium pits. Alternatively, while \nthe Horizon’s Pride originally read the fire perimeter around \nGrensvayl as volcanic activity, Lan’s crew may eventually \nrealise that something far more unusual sits at that location. \nHowever, the Caele’s animosity means that the Kill-team \nmust either circumvent or openly defy the interdiction to \nleave the city. The latter brings an assault from a Horde of \nAuran warriors (see At War with the Golden People).\nIf the Battle-Brothers still want to attempt relations \nwith the Aurans after dealing with Grensvayl on their own \nterms, it becomes a far more difficult task. However, their \ndeeds in the settlement (and perhaps even their fight with \nthe Auran warriors) could also be used to garner respect \nby a clever negotiator.\n23\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\npenal BarraCkS\nThis large structure—in the very centre of the area—is no \nmore than treated hides stretched over a framework of bone. \nThe heat from the pits means nothing else is needed to stay \nwarm, and the over-sized tent exists mainly to ward off the \nweather. Here, the Auran criminals sleep on piles of furs and \ntake their meals. They are just waking as light enters the \ngolden sky, retrieving dried meat and fruit from nearby \nstorage boxes for the morning. Should the Kill-team ven-\nture too close or fail an important Silent Move \nTest and be noticed by the prisoners, they do not \nraise an alarm. Many of them stare; a few may even \ntry to approach, but they have nothing to gain \nfrom starting a combat or alerting Karthas.\nconversing with the convicts\nIf the Battle-Brothers choose to converse with (or \nfollow up later with) the Aurans put to work in \nthe promethium wells, they may learn some \nadditional facts about their situation. A term \nof service in a labour camps is a common \nAuran method for dealing with those who \nbreak one of their few laws. Murderers and \nother highly dangerous men are put to death. Most \nof those here are guilty of a lesser crime such as theft \nor cowardice in battle. Although the labour of drawing the \npromethium is unpleasant, the prisoners are given ample food \nand time to rest. Some Space Marines may see this as humane, \nwhile others might see it as unforgivably weak. Most feudal \nserfs across the Imperium have worse living conditions, and \nImperial criminal punishments include conscription to a short \nlife of bloody combat in the Imperial Guard Penal Legions, \nusually on a hellish Death World.\nflooded CaveS\nSubmerged caves border some of the open promethium pools, \nrock chambers that are mostly flooded by the black crude and \nhave only a few feet of clearance between the black liquid and \nthe stone ceiling. The new brood of Genestealers lurk here \nand grow their numbers, doubly cautious after their brush \nwith exposure from the Adepta Sororitas’s investigation. The \ncreatures only stay in the caverns with promethium lakes of \ntolerable temperatures, providing an easy place to hide for \nshort periods. The Genestealers are smart enough not to \nreveal themselves to an armoured Deathwatch Kill-team, at \nleast not yet, when they have nothing to gain from battle. \nIf the Battle-Brothers take an interest in exploring any of \nthe submerged caves, the xenos hide in the black depths of \nthe promethium lakes. While it would take a Hellish (–60) \nAwareness Test to confirm that something is lurking in the \nthick, fluctuating liquid, the Battle-Brothers may still get an \nuneasy sense that something is watching them.\nthe fate of SiSter raChayel\nThe Battle-Brothers are not the first servants of \nthe Emperor to make it to the Black Depths. Sister \nRachayel came this way before them. It was here \nthat she found the secret the Aurans strove so hard \nto bury—not promethium siphoning or criminal \nlabour, but something far worse. She uncovered \nwhat the Caele himself still does not know: since \nbeing infected by the brood, Karthas has turned the \nsecret promethium pits into a breeding ground for \nmore monstrosities.\nSome caverns are so flooded with crude \npromethium that they are unsafe to drain, filled \nalmost to the ceiling with black liquid and noxious \nfumes. It is here that the infected warriors and \nGenestealers hide, venturing out at night to hunt and \nmultiply. Sister Rachayel discovered this xenos den. \nUnfortunately the xenos also discovered her. They \ndid not kill her, but rather attempted to implant her \nwith their corrupted seed. Refusing to become an \ninstrument of the unclean, Sister Rachayel fell upon \nher own sword. Knowing that her disappearance \nwould cause questions, Karthas brought her body \nback to Haistand and hoped it would be dismissed \nas a suicide.\n24\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nMonsters in the Deep\nWhat if—through luck or persistence—the Kill-team \nuncovers the Genestealers here at the Black Depths? This \nmay change their understanding of the stakes, but it doesn’t \nchange Rylus’s mind about the proving. He is honour-bound \nnot to let the Space Marines near Grensvayl until they have \nshown respect for Auran tradition, and will fight to the \ndeath to keep them from doing otherwise. Additionally, the \nBroodlord does not reside with the rest of his offspring in \nthe promethium wells. While the Kill-team may reduce the \nnumber of free alien predators, they cannot cut off the head \nof the beast here and now.\npoint of departure\nOn the edge of the perimeter roughly opposite where the \nconvoy entered, more carts sit unattended. A few large clay \njars filled with promethium occupy a small portion of their \nbeds. There is also a stand of bows and arrows used to clear \nthe sky when these vehicles are ready to begin their journey. \nHowever, the lack of activity (or beasts of burden) here, and \nthe large amount of empty space to be filled in the carts \nsuggests they won’t be setting out any time soon. \nThe Battle-Brothers have several options at this point. \nDay is dawning, which makes it harder to hide their trespass \nagainst the edict to remain in Haistand. It is possible to follow \nthe trail the promethium-filled carts have made on previous \njourneys with a Challenging (+0) Tracking Test, although \nthere is no telling how far the path may lead. Should the \nBattle-Brothers decide to undertake this journey, they also \nquickly find it is nearly impossible to do so in secret. See the \nGo Set a Watchman Encounter below.\nGO SET A wATcHMAN\nWhile the path from Haistand to the crude pits is unguarded, \nthe long route from the pits to the promethium’s destination is \ncarefully watched. Caele Rylus has taken great pains to ensure \nthat the secret of Grensvayl’s taint stays concealed from outsiders. \nThe carts run a flat, open trail through the grasslands, with few \nplaces to hide. Furthermore, a Routine (+20) Awareness Test \nspots the first of many watch posts along the route.\nUnless the Battle-Brothers are all equipped with masking \nscreens or some other means of crossing the open plains without \nnotice, they are almost certainly spotted before reaching the \ndistant settlement of Grensvayl. Because of the Kill-team’s \nunusual status in the political situation, as well as the Caele’s \ninterest in them, the news of their trespass is delivered swiftly \nand directly to the Caele. Rylus himself rides up at the head \nof a small war host approximately 3 hours after the Battle-\nBrothers are first spotted heading west. Read aloud or paraphrase   \nthe following:\nThe approaching party of Aurans raises a small cloud of dust, \ncrossing the open terrain surprisingly silently on their fleet-footed \nreptilian mounts. The group consists of several dozen warriors, \nwith the Caele’s tall figure in their vanguard.\nGive your players a chance to react to the oncoming group. \nAssume the Battle-Brothers sight them at a distance of about \n60 metres, which gives them 2 Rounds before the Caele \nreaches them. (You may wish to increase this if the Battle-\nBrothers make Awareness Tests). Assuming they don’t pre-\nempt the approach, continue:\nThe Caele, Rylus Darkscourge, signals his warriors to hold a \nfew metres back, and only he rides up to you on his green and \nbronze theratryx. He speaks quietly but with authority. “You \nhave broken the laws of Aurum. My laws. Your Imperium has \nclaimed to come in peace. If this is so, do not push us to war. I too \nbelieve we can benefit one another, but this is not the way”\nRylus urges the Kill-team to return to the capital. His own \nlaws forbid off-worlders from leaving Haistand, and he would \nbe dishonoured if he knowingly allowed them to violate his \nedict. As mentioned in his description on page 21, the Caele \nbelieves that the Space Marines might be the answer to his \nconundrum of the stand-off with the Imperials, but it is not a \nroute he can explore if they openly defy him. He emphasises \nhis belief that they can find a peaceful solution if they return \nwith him to Haistand, but makes it clear he is willing to enforce \nhis laws by whatever means necessary if they do not comply.\nIf the Kill-team agrees to return with the war party, modify \nthe Meeting the Caele encounter (assuming they have not \nspoken with him yet). After reconvening in the audience \nchamber, begin with his explanation of why it is imperative \nthat they keep with Auran law and traditions if they are truly \nto do any good on the planet. If the Kill-team refuses to return, \nand tries to continue following the cart tracks, the Aurans do \nattack them. \ngM guidanCe: Clarity and \nConSequenCe\nOne of the great joys of roleplaying is the players’ \nability to make any choice they can imagine, with the \nGame Master able to ensure that the world reacts in \nappropriate and compelling way. The GM should never \nforbid them from choosing a certain path, but he also \nhas a responsibility to make sure the players understand \ntheir situation with the same clarity as their characters \nwould. The Kill-team has the very real possibility \nof failing a Primary Objective, causing the death of \ndozens of Imperial citizens and starting a war. If this \nis the Kill-team’s choice, let them make it. However, \nit can be easy for players to forget all the details of an \nadventure, particularly if a Mission is broken up over \nseveral weeks of real time. If the players seem about to \nmake a detrimental choice, a generous GM will at least \nmake sure they remember that one of their Primary \nObjectives is to settle the matter of Aurum peacefully. \nIf they are clear on this fact, then anything goes!\n25\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nRylus leads a formidable number of Auran warriors against \nthe Battle-Brothers on the open plain. The war party rode \nafter the Kill-team on theratryx, and thus the majority of the \nwarriors are mounted. Use the Mounted Combatants rules \nand the warrior and theratryx profiles in the appendix to \nrepresent a Horde of mounted Auran warriors at a Magnitude \nof 45. Rylus (who counts as an Elite enemy and should not \nbe combined with his soldiers) fights on foot. If the Battle-\nBrothers win the fight, nothing is stopping them from finishing \nthe remaining 150 kilometres of the trek to Grensvayl. The \nsettlement’s sentries do not receive them well, but should be \neasily dispatched by Space Marines (see The Tainted City).\nAttacking the Caele is an act of war with far more serious \nimplications than the skirmish on the plains. Rylus has the \nTouched by Fates Trait, so in all likelihood he survives the \nbattle to return to Haistand. (Even if he did not, Alkedre is still \nthere to succeed him.) See At War with the Golden People.\na poor negotiating StanCe\nShould the Battle-Brothers fight and lose to the Auran \nwarriors on the way to Grensvayl, they wake up, minus a Fate \nPoint, apparently underwater. When they get their bearings it \nbecomes clear they lie at the bottom of a deep stone well. The \nwater is about 2 metres high, and the sheer sides of the pit \nextend up some 15 metres. Their visible weapons have been \ntaken, although they are still in their power armour. \nThey are in fact in the well outside the Caele’s homestead, \nas he has nowhere else to keep such mighty prisoners. A few \nmoments after they wake, the Caele appears over the rim of \nthe well for one last attempt at reason. His attitude towards \nthe Battle-Brothers is not nearly as open as it otherwise \nwould have been, and he is deeply troubled by any deaths \nthat occurred. However, his objective remains unchanged: see \nthe Battle-Brothers prove themselves so that they can purge \nGrensvayl without offending Auran honour. On the brink of \nwar, his tactics are less than diplomatic. He warns the Battle-\nBrothers that if they do not agree to redeem themselves before \nhis people by undergoing a Proving, he will take their actions \nas overtures of war—and he is as good as his word.\nIf rebuffed again, Rylus launches an attack on the Imperial \nNPC’s in Haistand. He leaves the Battle-Brothers in the pit, \ntelling them he wants them to see the bloody results of their \nstubbornness before they die. The Kill-team can probably \ndevise a clever way to climb or break out of their makeshift \nholding cell. If they can’t, the surviving Imperial NPC’s have \ngood reason to want to extract them as quickly as possible.\nat war with the golden people \nThe Aurans strike the Imperium where it is the most vulnerable: \nby attacking the civilians and isolated representatives inside \nthe capital. Auran warriors quickly cut down the handful of \nMissionaries, scribes, and traders in Haistand as soon as the \nword of war is given. The Battle-Brothers encounter their \nbloody corpses on the streets and in the Overlook when they \nre-enter the city. Archibal Heth and his handful of guardsmen \nprove more difficult, barricading themselves inside the \nAspirance and raining las fire down any foe that gets close to \nthe building. The Kill-team’s first indication that violence has \nerupted in the city may be a vox broadcast from Heth himself, \nreporting the situation.\nAt this point, the Kill-team is free to address the situation \nas they wish: aid Heth and his guardsmen, bring the fight \nback to the Caele’s homestead, or proceed towards their \nobjective at the end of the trail to the west.\nAssuming the Battle-Brothers do cleanse Grensvayl despite \nthe enmity of the Aurans, they have an opportunity to end the \nhostilities—if they so choose. By this point much bitterness \nand blood has probably built up between the two factions. \nHowever, destroying the Genestealers proves much about the \nAdeptus Astartes, even if it shames the Aurans to admit it. If \nthe Battle-Brothers use this deed as the basis of a truce, the \nCaele grudgingly accepts. How much Rylus (or his successor) \nis willing to actually forgive is another matter entirely. Good \nroleplaying (or exceptional Charm Tests) are required to \nprogress beyond anything more than the same stalemate the \nplanet was in when the Kill-team arrived. Depending on how \nwell or poorly any such attempt to change the Caele’s attitude \ngo, the Victory Feast could still end up being in their honour, \nor it might be to memorialise fictional Auran heroes taking \npost-mortem credit for the Kill-team’s deeds.\nMounted CoMBatantS\nThe Aurans ride theratryx into battle (and an enterprising \nBattle-Brother may wish to try his hand at this as well). \nA character who is mounted suffers a –20 penalty on \nDodge Tests and uses the mount’s movement rate instead \nof his own. In melee combat, the mount may make one \nstandard attack in addition to any attacks of the rider. If \nthe rider has the Wrangling Skill, the mount may use a \nWrangling Skill Test instead of a Weapon Skill Test to \nhit with its melee attack. One of the rider’s hands must \nbe used to control the reins of his mount. Hits against \na mounted character in ranged combat must roll an \nadditional 1d5. On a result of 1–3, the mount is hit. Any \nother result indicates that the rider is hit instead. \nHere are some guidelines for the GM if the Battle-\nbrothers end up fighting the Auruan cavalary as a \nHorde: use the mount’s movement rate and Toughness \nfor the Horde, and add an additional 10 magnitude.\nduty unto death\nNo matter what happens with the local populace, Aurum \nis still a planet that the Imperium wants to claim, and \nit still has a xenos infestation. The Battle-Brothers are \nunlikely to let personal conflicts keep them from seeking \nout and destroying the threat before calling the Mission \ncomplete. Should anger make them forgetful, Lan is sure \nto ask them about that Objective before breaking orbit \nand, if necessary, he reminds them of their duty to the \nCrusade and their Watch Captain.\n26\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe Divested \nHunt\n“Steel is only as good as the man who wields it. Words are only as \ngood as the man who gives them. You stand here today to be judged \nnot by your tribe’s name or your possessions, but by your skill and \ncourage.”\n–from the Opening Rituals of the Storm Wardens’ Trials of \nAspiration\nI\nf the Battle-Brothers accept Rylus’s proposal, Alkedre \ntakes responsibility for preparing the Battle-Brothers. She \nexplains that the nature of a warrior’s proving varies with \nthe standing he is vying for in society. The Battle-Brothers \nare to undergo the trial of the most honoured Aurans: the \nDivested Hunt. This ritual sends warriors to the Reaving \nCanyons, where some of the planet’s most fearsome predators \ndwell. Using only their skill and the ritual Auran weapons \nthat are a part of the ceremony, they must slay a Diablodon, \nthe king of the planet’s midasaur strains. \nThe trial requires that the Kill-team leave behind all \ntheir blessed power armour and weapons. (Techmarines \nare required to detach any servo-arms or servo-harnesses. \nThe Aurans assume any such appendages must be a kind of \nweapon. In fact, if any of the Battle-Brothers have obvious \npermanent augmetics, they may have difficulty convincing \nthe Aurans that they do not come off ). The Caele offers to \npersonally guard the Kill-team’s possessions if their well-\nbeing is of concern to the Battle-Brothers. (They have several \nother options for safe-keeping as well, such as contacting \nLan or Heth.) Alkedre supplies any Battle-Brother who needs \ngarments with leather coverings.\nThe Sinsir believes that the Imperium could improve life \non Aurum, and thus strongly wants the Battle-Brothers to \nsucceed in winning over Rylus and the populace. She does her \nbest to prepare them for the Hunt, and answers any additional \nquestions they have about the trial or the canyons. The \nrules of the Hunt are simple and immutable. Bring nothing \nwith them into the Canyons. Take no aid from anyone but \nthemselves. Return with a trophy—at least the head— from \nan adult Diablodon, and swear an oath that they took its life. \nShe also describes their quarry:\n“It is the largest of the Reaving Canyon’s denizens. It stalks on \ntwo legs, and favours the inferno of the Deadlands.” She sketches \na distinctively uneven four-toed print in the dirt “That is the \nshape of its track.” Then she draws their attention to her brilliant \nred armour. “But most-over, you will know it by the colour of its \nscales. Its hide is patterned like the blazes of hell itself.”\nIf the Battle-Brothers ask her about the history of her \narmour, she confirms that it is from a slain Diablodon. \nFurthermore, each of the scales hanging in her hair is from a \ndifferent one of the creatures slain by her hand. \nTHE REAVING cANYONS\nWhen the Battle-Brothers are ready, Rylus, Alkedre, and scores \nof curious Aurans make the trek through the winding farmland \nto the Reaving Canyons. The entrance fissure is clearly marked \nby talismans of protection and splayed human skeletons that \nwarn of the danger. The onlookers are silent to a man when \nthe Battle-Brothers cross into the Canyons. Rylus solemnly \nwishes them luck.\nJust past the threshold stands a weathered stone plinth \nwith a selection of worn but reliable Auran weapons: the \nimplements of the hunt. Assume at least three of each weapon \ntype is available in the primitive arsenal. The profiles for the \nimplements are given in Table 1–1 on page 28.\nThe terraced path is narrow as the Battle-Brothers enter the \nnetwork of canyons. Aurum’s lauded virility is obvious as they \nproceed. Grasses grow on sheer slabs of stone; climbing plants \nflourish as they cling to the rocky walls. A canopy of trees \nlining canyons’ summit mostly blocks the amber sky. Within \nthat shade the vegetation is not tall but dense, and it rustles \nconstantly with the movement of unseen creatures through \nit. Not long after the entrance disappears, muffled reptilian \nshrieks begin to echo through the lush maze, the calls of its \nmany inhabitants. Even as the passage widens, it is still only \nwide enough to accommodate two Battle-Brothers at a time. \n27\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\ntheratryx neSting groundS\nThe first area where the terrain differs is an open pit of high \ngolden grasses. It is immediately evident that the area has \nresidents. Wild theratryx nest here. Clutches of eggs peek out \nof pebbled mounds at the centre and around the circumference \nof the uneven ring. The bright, scaly shoulders and heads of \nthe parents are visible as they prowl through the grass. The \npath branches to the east and west on the other side of the \nnesting ground. \nIf the Battle-Brothers attempt to go undetected by the \ntheratryx, it requires a Challenging (+0) Silent Move Test. \n(Assume the Test is made when the characters are midway \nthrough the field, closest to the greatest concentration of \ntheratryx and therefore most likely to be detected.) The Test \nbecomes Ordinary (+10) if they reduce their profile by crossing \nthe field one at a time. However, this leaves anyone caught by \nthe protective animals further from the support of his squad. \nThe diameter of the crossing is roughly 100 metres.\nIf anyone is detected or the Battle-Brothers choose to fight \ntheir way through, the theratryx form a Horde of Magnitude \n30. (Use their profile on page 50 to form a Horde.)\nreaverS of the Sky\nThe western passage climbs upwards to an open plateau \nwhere the sky teems with winged reptiles. Their screeching \ncries increase as they scent the Kill-team, but they are \nscavengers who prey on weak, single targets. They will not \nattack a large group unless provoked. The opposite side of \nthe plateau overlooks the broiling red Deadlands hundreds \nof metres below. The cliff side is steep but has ample hand-\nholds, requiring an Ordinary (+10) Climb Test to ascend \nor descend.\ngnarled tunnel\nThe eastern path leads into a damp, dim tunnel through the \nearth. Over time the trees on the cliffs above have worked \ntheir roots through the rock and soil here, and centuries of \ndripping water and slow growth hollowed out a misshapen \ncavern between the tangled roots. The passage is forty metres \nlong. It is short enough that light enters dimly from both \nsides of the passage, but long and dark enough to make the \nBattle-Brothers keenly aware of the absence of their helmets \nand their autosenses. \nAs the Battle-Brothers work their way through the tightly \npacked roots, they occasionally have to push or cut one \naside. Approximately thirty metres in, they push through a \nparticularly large cluster of the wooden tendrils, and thin \ntrails of dirt begin to stream from the ceiling. Roots begin \ndropping and swaying as the tunnel destabilises. Have each \ncharacter make a Challenging (+0) Climb, Contortionist \nor Survival Test to force their way through the remaining \nwoody stems before the passage collapses around them. \nAnyone who fails the Test takes 1d10+6 Impact Damage as \nthey are caught in the cave-in; their comrades must also dig \nthem out. \nThe tunnel leads out of a cliff face at the edge of the \nDeadlands. (The collapse may happen on the way in or out \nof the canyons. If the Battle-Brothers collapse the tunnel on \ntheir way in, they need to exit via the sky plateau.)\nthe deadlandS\nThis red gorge stands out on the golden-green surface of \nAurum like an inflamed wound. Mantle plumes bring magma \nclose to the planet’s surface, scorching the ground and \nregularly venting hot gases. The poisoned air and shocks of \nhigh temperature keeps anything from growing in this fissure, \nearning it and the surrounding plain their attribution in the \nAuran language.\nSoon after the Kill-team enters the Deadlands, the effects \nof the harsh, acidic air become apparent. Any character who \ndoes not pass a Difficult (–10) Toughness Test (modified by \nthe Oolitic Kidney and Multi-lung) suffers a level of Fatigue. \nThis Test increases to Hard (–20) if the character does not \npossess a functioning Mucranoid to protect them from the \nSpaCe Marine trialS\nThe idea of proving oneself worthy should hardly be \nforeign to most Space Marines. It is standard practice \nfor Chapters to have some way to select promising \nyouths to receive the Space Marine implants. These \ntests are varied but always gruelling, ranging from the \nBlood Angels’ contests at Angel’s Fall to the aspirant \nrituals of Fenris which culminate in the Test of Morkai. \nCompared to what many of the Battle-Brothers had to \nendure to earn the place they hold as a Space Marine, \nthe Divested Hunt may not seem unreasonable.\nTable 1–1: Implements of the Hunt\nNameClassRangeRoFDmgPenClipRldSpecialkg\nFang-Tipped SpearMelee– – 1d10+1 R2– N/A– 2\nAuran GyrbladeMelee– –1d10 R0– N/APrimitive, Special*3\nTalon BladeMelee– –1d10 R0– N/A–1\nBone SwordMelee– –1d10+1 R0– N/APrimitive, Balanced2\nBow & ArrowsBasic15mS/–/–1d10+2 R111/2Primitive4\n*A gyrblade does an additional point of Damage per degree of success on the Attack roll.

This Fatigue cannot be removed from a \ncharacter until he is out of the punishing environment. \nAs the Battle-Brothers venture deeper into the broken \nground, they can hear the sounds and see the silhouettes of \nmidasaurs moving through the thick fumes. The sulphuric \nstench becomes punctuated by the even more stomach-\nchurning scent of rotting flesh. It issues from a broken shelf \nof rock. An Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test spots several \nof the tracks Alkedre drew on the incline leading up to the \nshelf. They have found the Diablodon’s lair.\nthe devil’S BoneS\nA Routine (+0) Tracking Test can decipher that the tracks \nare the comings and goings of one creature, not a pack. How \nthe encounter with the enormous creature goes depends \ngreatly on the strategy the Kill-team employs. They may lie \nin wait for it outside the lair and plan an ambush, or they may \nproceed directly in to confront it.\nThe source of the stench is obvious as they draw closer \nto the Diablodon’s lair. The ledge is an exhibit of bones and \nfreshly stripped carcasses, and tattered remains of kills in \nevery stage of decomposition in between. Some picked bones \nare human while many others are from the same smaller \npredators the Kill-team passed in the Canyon. The ledge is \n20 metres up, with a wide ramp of jagged stone leading to \nit. When the Battle-Brothers reach the apex, read aloud or \nparaphrase the following:\nA fine powder of crushed bone coats the uneven floor of the \nDiablodon’s lair. The recessed ledge is the ruddy colour of a \ncharnel house, painted in dried blood and heaped with skeletons. \nA gas vent deeper beneath the overhang spews an acrid yellow \ncloud from the cavity. Like a daemon stalking through the smoke \nof hell, an obscured red creature prowls the lair. It noses at a \nscrap-coated ribcage. A sharp cracking sound follows as it tears \na rib free to devour the marrow.\nIf the Battle-Brothers do not lure it out or charge in, the \nDiablodon eventually scents them. Its head shoots up as it \nscents new prey. When the Battle-Brothers get their first look \nat the creature, read or paraphrase the following:\nThis scarlet monster is the pinnacle predator on a planet teeming \nwith deadly midasaurs. It has a distinctive sagittal crest that seems \nto blaze in the sunlight, and stands taller than a Dreadnought. Its \ngiant yellowed claws alone are the size of power swords, each one \npermanently stained crimson by the blood of the dead—along \nwith its overlapping needle fangs.\nWhen it spots the Battle-Brothers, it charges with a \nroar as loud as a Valkyrie’s engines. See page 48 for the   \nDiabodon’s profile.\nPROVEN wARRIORS\nWhen the Battle-Brothers emerge from the Canyons, a pair of \nAuran youths sit outside the threshold, waiting for them. They \nleap up when they see the Kill-team. At first they stare, and then \nthey grin. One of them races to a tethered theratryx and then \nrides off in the direction of Haistand to announce the news. The \nother leads the Battle-Brothers back to Haistand.\nBy the time they reach the city, word has obviously spread. \nThe Divested Hunt is a rare occurrence, and the locals pay a great \ndeal more attention to the Battle-Brothers when they return than \nwhen they arrived (particularly if they are displaying the head \nor similar trophy of a Diablodon). That is not to say that the \nreception is warm; the Aurans still keep their distance, and seem \ngenerally undecided whether they should attack or cheer.\nRylus awaits them at his homestead. He welcomes them back \nwith sincere praise and congratulations. He indicates that they \nnow have serious matters to discuss, once they are recovered and \nre-armed. \nexpanding the CanyonS\nThis section assumes the Kill-team moves through the \nReaving Canyons at a relatively brisk pace. However, \nif your group is eager for more action, takes longer in \ngame play hours to traverse the area (or simply seems \nto be enjoying this part of the adventure and you want \nto expand on it), below are some options to expand on \nthe Reaving Canyons.\nland of the MidaSaurS\nAs the name suggests, vicious reptilian predators lurk \nin every corner of this region. You may wish to add \nadditional fights if the pacing calls for it. Any dangerous \nlizard makes a thematically appropriate encounter. \nMany varieties are presented in this adventure, or you \ncan invent your own.\na queSt for Survival\nAs presented here, the Battle-Brothers should have \nrelatively little trouble locating a Diablodon and \nreturning to Haistand in the course of a day. However, \nif the size of the canyons grows, so does the difficulty \nand duration of the task. The Hunt can easily expand \ninto a quest of days, requiring the Battle-Brothers to \nrely on their skills and implants to help them survive \nwithout their power armour. Tracking Tests may be \nneeded to follow their quarry over vast distances before \nthey can finally slay it.\n29\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe Tainted \nCity\nBarren and blighted was the land. Even as I stood upon the parched \nsoil, I could feel corruption seeding my lungs with every breath of \ndry air. The days of pride and plenty have been consumed by the \nflames of vanity.\n–From the Corpse of Corulsiem\nO\nnce the Space Marines have retrieved their equipment \nand taken whatever rest they desire, Rylus meets \nthem on the roof terrace atop the main house. The \nrectangular terrace has little ornamentation or appointments, \nbut it does provide a perfect view of the green stepped \nfarmlands below and the sprawling grasslands bathed in the \nlight of the planet’s golden sky. The tile beneath their feet \nshows a worn geographical etching of the surrounding land, \nwith Haistand in the centre. Rylus awaits them on the roof. \nHe addresses them in a sincere but reserved tone:\n“Well done, my friends. Truly you live up to your legends. Thank \nyou for undertaking the Trial. It will mean much to my people. It \nis only proper that we celebrate your great accomplishment as we \nwould any warrior’s. However, I suspect that first you would like \nto speak of the lurking, scythed death that has infected Aurum.”\nRylus at last lays bare all that he knows of the Malissectors. \nHe tells the Kill-team how Grensvayl withdrew further from \ncontact and became more isolationist year after year. At the last \nharvest, they sent no crops at all, where once the Commerce \nAisles had spilled over with red pears and handfruit from their \norchards. Rylus sent a war party to the settlement to see what \nhad happened. Only a handful of his warriors returned, and \nthose who did had barely escaped with their lives. They spoke \nof Aurans enslaved to a six-limbed race of monstrosities, and \nof horrible cross-breeds between human and beast.\nRylus has kept the city quarantined ever since and ensured \nthat no one—Auran or off-worlder—visits the blighted \ncity. He admits that some of his motivation was pride; he \nwas ashamed to acknowledge that the bodies and spirits of \nhis people had become so impure. However, he had other \nmotivations for his constant denial of the Imperium; sooner \nor later either he or the Battle-Brothers broach the topic of \nTyranids or Genestealers. When this happens, read aloud or \nparaphrase his commentary:\n“Your Crusade has talked of these devouring mantises that bear \ndown on all of us from the edge of what is known. If I did not \nbelieve them once I certainly cannot deny it now. In truth, it was \nnever a matter of disbelief. Aurum is a world of many beauties \nand many dangers. Why should the galaxy be any different? The \nreal choice before me has always been one of the lesser enemy. I \nhave learned all that I can of your Imperium. Are they truly a \nkinder master to their slaves than the Malissectors?” He shakes \nhis head. “But do not let my musings distract you from your duty. \nWhatever I may think of the other men of the Eagle, you are \nundoubtedly worthy. I grant you leave to go where you will on \nAurum. These Malissectors, these Gene Stealers, are a plague on \nall of us. Is there any aid you require in purging them?”\nRylus provides them with directions to the settlement, \nwhich is about 150 kilometres west from Haistand. If they \nmake any other requests, he grants them to the best of his \nability. He is reluctant—but not unwilling—to send Auran \nwarriors if they request it, for he knows any he sends are \nunlikely to return.\nGRENSVAYL\nGrensvayl was once no different from the hundreds of other \nagricultural settlements that dot Aurum’s fertile mesas. The town \nwas built where the Espri River splits into 3 branches, providing \nnatural irrigation to a large orchard on the eastern edge of the \ntown. Then the Magi of Samech came to plunder Aurum’s \nDecavane Crystals. The apostate Mechanicus of the Jericho \nReach’s most infamous Forge World have a fascination with xenos \nspecimens. They brought several Genestealers with them as tools \nof misdirection and destruction.\nTheir plan had both a short term and a long term goal. For \nthe first few years of the heretical machine cult’s occupation, the \nGenestealers did what they were born to do: destabilise and thin \nthe enemy ranks. Their nightly depredations created such an \natmosphere of paranoia that a few strange noises or lights from the \ncliffs seemed just another eerie mystery. Certainly with rumours of \nlurking monsters, the inhabitants felt little desire to poke around \nin dark caves. In the long run, the apostate Mechanicus hoped \nthat the infection would spread, leading the Hive Fleet to Aurum \nand denying this prize world to the Imperium. This fate could \nstill come to pass.\nTheir scheme went smoothly—at first. The Magi did not \ncount on the Caele being so quick to react to the odd behaviour \nof Grensvayl’s population. After several unsuccessful attempts to \ncleanse the settlement, Rylus instituted the fiery quarantine which \nhas stood to this day. While not their ideal outcome, this served \nthe Magi well enough, as it allowed them to continue their mining \nunhindered. However, as the years marched on, the number of \npurestrain Genestealers increased and the supply of other living \nbeings diminished. Like most Tyranids, Genestealers can subsist \non nearly any form of biomatter, but their instincts drive them to \nhunt animal prey first. The creatures grew ever more predatory \nand clever as they grew more desperate. Eventually they found a \nway into the mining caverns, putting a bloody and premature end \nto the Decavane crystal collection.\n30\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nMap of Grensvayl and Environs\n31\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nthe ring of fire\nThe location of Grensvayl is visible from many kilometres \naway. It is marked by a column of smoke by day and a blaze \nof fire by night. The town lies in a deep, dead-ended ravine. \nThe former gap in the cliffs that afforded entrance to the town \nis buried in a wall of broken stone hundreds of metres high. \nTopping this barricade, and continuing in an uneven circle \naround the entire cliff circumference, is an eternally roaring \nblaze. Even as the Battle-Brothers approach, several dozen \nmen guard the fiery perimeter with the finest weapons Auran \ncraftsmen can produce. Sweat shines on their tanned skin as \nthey vigilantly watch for any creatures attempting to break \nthrough. It is obvious some xenos have in the past, as a few \nof the men carry Genestealer talons as trophies. Read aloud or \nparaphrase the following as the Kill-team approaches:\nThe settlement finally ceases to be a flicker of balefire on the \nhorizon and materialises into a blazing inferno. The tainted \nsettlement of Grensvayl has been completely sealed into a circle \nof cliffs by manmade avalanches. Dozens of Auran sentries \nkeep watch from above, and drip a steady coat of unrefined \npromethium down the cliff edges to keep the blazing wall of \nfire fuelled. Barely visible through the flames is the scorched, \ndesolate town. Its river is close to dry; its buildings are burnt and \nblackened; its famed orchards are withered. Yet, something moves \nin the dead town: hunched, hideous shapes weaving between the \nflickering shadows.\nheydal\nHeydal has command of the fire perimeter. He is lanky and \n(like most of the men here) streaked with soot. It is difficult \nto tell whether his braided hair was always black or has just \npermanently taken on the colour. Heydal meets the Battle-\nBrothers if they have any requests or questions for the perimeter \nguard. He is laconic and grim from years of this hellish duty, \nbut he is also extremely receptive to the possibility the Kill-\nteam presents of finally seeing this matter concluded. Note \nthat Heydal is the man who sold Beyrr the Genestealer claw \nduring his last visit to Haistand; the Battle-Brothers may wish \nto follow up with him on this subject (see page 20).\nThe Battle-Brothers can enter Grensvayl from any point they \nchoose. Options include:\n• A stealth drop via Deathwatch Thunderhawk into the \nmiddle of town. (A less discreet drop via drop pod is \nalso possible, but it draws a Horde of Genestealers from   \nthe orchard).\n•Using melta torches or similarly powerful implements \nto unseal the recent cavern breach. However, this does \npresent the possibility of enemies sneaking out behind \nthe Adeptus Astartes if they are not careful.\n•A heavy coat of flame-retardant allows an armoured \nBattle-Brother to remain safely in the promethium-fuelled \nfire for approximately two minutes, long enough to climb \ndown the flaming part of the cliff.\nA Tireless Foe\nThe recent bid for freedom was far from the first by Grensvayl’s \ncursed population. Below are some of the most prominent \nescape attempts. Heydal may mention these events if asked; \nhe has been present since the beginning of the quarantine.\n•806.M41: Only a few months after the Caele sealed off \nthe ravine, a group of infected warriors found an opening \nwhere the river used to flow out through underground \nchannels. Fortunately a perimeter sentry spotted the \ninfected warriors as they started to cross the plains. The \nsentries were able to put the hideous beings down, but \nat a great loss of life. They promptly sealed the egress \npoints of all three river forks as well.\n•810.M41: The first sizeable generation of purestrain \nGenestealers matured in this period. One night they made \na coordinated push through the fire perimeter. Though \nbadly injured, the creatures still nearly overwhelmed the \nsentries. Only a few Auran warriors survived the bloody \nnight.\n•815.M41: One of the xenos, possibly the original \nspecimen, had grown in power and cunning over the \nyears. It manifested psychic powers and managed to \nmesmerise one of the sentries into letting it pass through \nthe barrier. Fortunately other warriors witnessed its \nescape and managed to bring it down.\n•817.M41: Karthas persuades Rylus to try wiping out \nthe Malissectors one last time. He leads a war party into \nGrensvayl with disastrous results.\nAND INTO THE FIRE\nThe blockage at the entrance to Grensvayl mostly redirects \nthe Espri River, but enough water seeps through that a stream \nstill flows through the town’s former riverbed. Most of the \ntown is covered in soot from years under the perimeter fire. \nSeveral wooden buildings have burnt down from heat and \nsparks, and even the stone structures show disrepair. The \nambient noise in Grensvayl is a contrasting blend of the \nroaring flame above, and the trickling flow of water. \nOptional: Rain of Fire\nIf the GM wants to emphasise the effects of the perpetual \nfire perimeter above, he may occasionally call for characters \nto make Ordinary (+10) Dodge Tests to avoid the flaming \nglobules of pitch that drip off the cliff sides and fall upon \nthe town. Any Space Marine hit by the fire suffers 2d10 E \nDamage to his Body location. (Be sure to check to see if any \nof the characters are carrying a Charm, as this is precisely the \nsort of random misfortune such talismans ward against.)\nthe Bridge\nThis stone bridge once arched over the fork in the Espri \nRiver, serving as a landmark and meeting place. Now it soars \nuselessly high above the diminished water flow.\n32\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nOptional Encounter: Ambush\nA pair of Genestealers lurks in the shadows under the bridge \nsupports. If the Battle-Brothers cross over or under the \nbridge, they should make an Opposed Awareness Test against \nthe Genestealers’ Concealment. Those who fail the Test are \nsurprised as the creatures attack with their scything claws. If \nthe Battle-Brothers stay in the concealment of the bridge’s \nshadows, add 1 to the Arrival Counter.\nBe it here or elsewhere, read aloud or paraphrase the \nfollowing when the Kill-team faces the first Genestealers:\nThe hideous creatures emerging from the shadows are archetypes \nof alien evil. Their twisted scarlet bodies hunch forward, but \neven so the Genestealers are your equal in height. Thick black \ncarapace protects their six-limbed bodies, and each deadly \nappendage is tipped with the discoloured claws so infamous \nfor shredding Terminator armour. They rush from their hiding \nplaces, like a serrated tide in the colours of blood and night.\nthe orChard\nThe fact that the orchard’s orderly rows of trees have continued \nto grow proves the hardiness of all life under Aurum’s golden \nsky. The fruit-bearing trees have become only slightly stunted \ndespite the smoke obscuring the sun and choking the air. As \none of the few remaining sources of easily ingested bio-matter \n(even if it is far from the preferred choice for a Genestealer’s \nbloody palate), the orchard is teeming with Genestealers. The \nArrival Counter in the orchard always begins at 1, and the \nnimble Genestealers also gain +10 to all Concealment and \nSilent Move checks from the tree cover.\nIf the Kill-team sets fire to the orchard, intentionally or \nnot, it removes the Genestealers’ bonuses to stealth. However, \nit immediately sets the Arrival Counter to 0 (if it was not \nthere already) and forces all men and creatures in the area to \nmake an Agility Test each Round to avoid catching fire.\nthe weapon SMith\nThis building is slightly larger than many of the others in town. Its \ndoor has been ripped from the frame, leaving the remains of the \nworkshop exposed to the elements. The interior has suffered much \nof the same blackening as the rest of the settlement. Underneath \nthe grime, this establishment once created the primitive blades, \nbows, and spears that the Aurans wield. Now only a few crafting \ntools remain. The large supply of weapons—and anything that \nmight remotely serve as one—was stripped long ago.\nargrax StallS\nThis large sauriary is one of the few wooden structures \nremaining in Grensvayl, and it has certainly seen better days. \nLarge patches of the walls have completely burned away, and \nother ragged holes show where beasts clawed their way in, or \nout. It appears that some food supply survived until recently \nhere, because glittering Auran forage flies are still buzzing \nover the carcasses of dead livestock.\nStorehouSeS\nIn more peaceful times, these large buildings stored fruit and \nother crops harvested from the surrounding farmlands. Now, \nthey are vast, dark caverns to shelter Grensvayl’s twisted \ndenizens from the inferno above. The primary residents of \nthe storehouses are Infected Warriors, who form a Horde \nof Magnitude 25 when the Kill-team encounters them. The \nbattle may take place in the dark open expanse of barren \nholds, in the subterranean cellars, or both. The thick stone \nwalls provide good insulation not only from the unpleasant \nenvironment outside, but also for sound. Unless the GM \ndeems that the Kill-team is making an excessive volume of \nnoise, the Arrival Counter does not apply here.\norBital BoMBardMent\nThe Battle-Brothers may propose having the Horizon’s \nPride raze Grensvayl from orbit. This is possible, \nalthough Lan advises against it. The settlement’s depth \nin the ravine makes it unlikely that the ship could \nget a clean shot. Some of the notoriously resilient \nGenestealers would almost certainly manage to survive \nin the nearby caves and resultant rubble. The Kill-team \nwould still have to clear the town, and they would \nlose the elements of surprise and most of the number-\nmitigating terrain.\nStill, if the Battle-Brothers insist, Lan agrees to a \ntargeted lance strike. This changes the nature of the \nencounters in Grensvayl considerably. All of the exterior \nlocations become smoking ash and rubble. Several of \nthe infected warriors in the storehouses survive in the \ncellar levels. Move a suitable number of Genestealers \ninto the apostate caverns, and modify the Exterminate! \nset up as follows: The Arrival Counter starts at 1 instead \nof 2 because of the lack of obscuring cover. The Kill-\nTeam starts with 50 Kill Markers.\ndetonation iMMinent\nIf the Battle-Brothers pursue other large-scale tactics, \nthey may be able to obtain and modify a torpedo from \nthe Rogue Trader’s vessel to create a bomb they can \nplant in the town. The payload has sufficient destructive \npower to level the settlement, but they need to find a \nway to prevent the Genestealers from deactivating (or \nprematurely detonating!) the torpedo while the Battle-\nBrothers move to a safe distance, and they must still \nclear and seal the caverns and the storehouse cellar lest \nthe xenos shelter there.\n33\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nStaBle\nThe theratryx stable in Grensvayl is modest, built to house only \na half-dozen of the reptilian mounts. The bones of several of the \ncreatures still litter the dirt floor, along with a few chitin plates \nproving their sharp teeth and claws took at least one alien down \nwith them. Unlike the Argrax stalls, this smaller structure is stone \nand relatively undamaged. It is oblong, with a wide entrance where \ndouble doors once stood at each end. The Space Marines may see \na use for the building in their combat strategy. Its solid walls are \ngood protection, and the close quarters effectively prevent enough \nGenestealers to form a Horde from getting inside.\nHowever, the xenos are also clever enough that \nthey do not continue to charge into a disadvantageous \nbattleground. After sufficient casualties, they try other tactics   \nsuch as:\n•Tearing through weak points in the roof.\n•Breaking off their attack and feigning retreat as they lurk in \nwait for the Space Marines to emerge.\n•Summoning infected warriors to bombard the building with \nflaming projectiles\nOptional Encounter: circling Like Vultures\nIf the brood knows fresh lifeforms are inside the warrior lodge \n(below), it is quite possible Genestealers are keeping watch \noutside. This may be what draws the Kill-team’s attention to \nthe building.\nwarrior lodge\nMost Auran villages have a warrior lodge near one or more \ncritical points in the city, and Grensvayl is no exception. \nThis small, square structure is close to the sealed off ravine \nentrance. Three survivors from Karthas’s recent war party \nhave fortified themselves inside the lodge. While they have \nmade short, guarded runs to the riverbed for water, they \nare as short on food as the rest of Grensvayl. Furthermore, \none of their number has deduced the corrupting effect of \nthe Malissectors’ bite and shared his theory with the trio. All \nof them are now highly suspicious that the others might be \ninfected. They might be right. Read aloud or paraphrase the \nfollowing if the Battle-Brothers enter the lodge:\nYou are greeted by ivory blades when you step inside. Three \nAurans occupy the rectangular building, each in a different \ncorner, and each with their weapons held ready. They all have \na gaunt, malnourished cast. One is a bald man with small black \neyes; the second is a leathery older woman, and the third is a \nlittle more than a boy—around the age that the Adeptus Astartes \nchoose their recruits. All three freeze in indecision upon seeing \nyou—obviously not what they were expecting. The warriors \nglance at one another, but do not lower their weapons.”What \nnew beast is this?” the woman accuses with a shake of her \ngyrblade. The bald man points a lean finger at you.”It is a trick! \nMalissectors are hiding inside those statues!”\nexterMinate!\nThe Kill-team’s Objective in Grensvayl is straight \nforward: eliminate the xenos. The Genestealers can \nbe considered purged when the Battle-Brothers \naccumulate 100 Kill Markers. Genestealers count as \n2 Kill-Markers, while a Genestealer Horde counts \nfor 3 Kill-Markers per point of Magnitude. Some \nrecommended locations for encounters are included \nbelow, but the GM should feel free to place enemies \nin any place at any time within the town. The Infected \nWarriors do not yield any Kill Markers, but that doesn’t \nmean they can be ignored.\nthe threat of nuMBerS\nIndividual Genestealers are fearsome enough in close \ncombat—even to a Space Marine. However, they \nbecome truly deadly in large numbers. Much of this \nencounter focuses on the tactical need to engage the \ncreatures in small groups rather than draw the entire \npopulation on the Kill-team’s heads at once. The GM \nshould be sure the players understand (as much as their \ncharacters should, at any rate) the magnitude of threat \npresented by a full Horde of Genestealers.\nkeeping a SenSe of danger\nEvery outdoor combat in Grensvayl has higher stakes \nthan just the battle at hand. The noise, blood, and \nactivity of a fight draws Genestealers towards the fray. \nThe longer a fight drags on and the more explosions \nemanate from it, the greater the risk. Use the rules \nbelow to add to the sense of urgency:\nArrival Counter: The Kill-team begins each \nencounter with 2 Rounds before Genestealers notice \ntheir presence. Therefore, every combat starts with the \nArrival Counter set to 2 Rounds.\nSilent Death: As long as the Arrival Counter is not \nat 0, at the end of each Round in which no one fires a \nbolter or other weapon with a report, the Leader may \nmake a Silent Move Test. If he succeeds, add 1 to the \nArrival Counter.\nDrawn to the Kill: Every Round of Combat after the \nArrival Counter hits 0 (so beginning on the 3rd Round \nin most circumstances) 1d5 Genestealers arrive on the \nscene, beginning 50 metres away from the centre of \nthe combat. (This means they spend their first Round \nclosing.) When the total number of active Genestealers \npresent surpasses 15, they have reached a critical mass \nand become a Horde of Magnitude 10. From this point, \ntheir brood telepathy summons more of their kind at \nan accelerated rate, increasing the Horde’s Magnitude \nby 1d5+1 each Round after the Horde forms.\nThe maximum number of Genestealers that join in \none combat is 30 or a Horde of Magnitude 30. This \ncounts towards the total number of Kill-Markers \nneeded to complete the Mission Objective, and the \ntotal number of Genestealers in the settlement never \nexceeds 120 Kill-Markers’ worth.\n34\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nJaff\nThis young warrior had only just passed his Trial of Proving \nin time to join the ill-fated war party. As he is still maturing, \nhis build is slighter and shorter than the other Aurans. He \nappears to be holding together with remarkable resolve and \ncourage given the circumstances—he may even remind some \nof the Space Marines of their young selves. However, he \nrealises that he is far out of his depth in this situation, and \nfollows any direction given by the Space Marines.\nSrena\nThis sinewy, middle-aged woman shows obvious distrust for \nthe Space Marines. She was already trapped here when (or if ) \nthey completed the Divested Hunt, and hence eyes them with \nthe same haughty disdain most Aurans have for outsiders. She \nis not inclined to follow their lead without a strong argument.\nGorus\nAll Aurans must be warriors in order to survive, but nearly all \nof them have a second occupation. For most this is farming \nor hunting. In the case of Gorus, it is lorekeeping. He keeps \nthe oral histories and legends of the Auran tribes, giving him \na deep base of knowledge to draw upon. He is the most vocal \nabout the possibility that one of the other survivors could be \ninfected, and is the source of much of the doubt that spread \nthrough the small party. \nThe Battle-Brothers now must decide what to do with \nthe Aurans. Do they leave them here until the settlement is \ncleansed? Do they purge them? As Gorus points out, they could \nbe hosts for Genestealers. Whether one or more of the warriors \nare actually hosts is up to the GM’s discretion. To avoid over-\ncomplicating the rest of the settlement purge with a retinue of \nNPC’s, the GM should choose a scenario that avoids dragging \nthe entire survivor party through Grensvayl. Options include:\n•One of the warriors is under Genestealer dominion. The \nnext time the party faces a combat with the brood, the \ninfected warrior’s first act is to turn on the party—starting \nwith the easiest targets: the other Auran warriors.\n•At least one of the warriors is infected and makes a strong \nplea to stay fortified in the lodge until the Battle-Brothers \nhave cleansed the city. In reality, this is a contingency plan \nby the brood to spread their influence in Haistand even if \nthe colony here is eliminated.\n•All of the warriors are infected. They insist on reinforcing \nthe Battle-Brothers, and take the next opportunity to lead \nthem into an ambush.\n•None of the warriors are infected, but one or more have \nbeen driven insane by the constant state of fear and \nparanoia. They turn on their allies the instant someone \ntries to convince them to leave the lodge.\nIf at least one of the survivors is not under the influence of \nthe Genestealers, he is likely to tell the story of how Karthas \nled the warriors into the orchards. The Genestealers descended \nupon the war party, and paid no attention to Karthas as he \ncalmly walked away, leaving his men to their doom.\nthe geneStealer’S kiSS\nSooner or later the Battle-Brothers realise they are dealing with Genestealers. These creatures reproduce by implanting \ntheir own genetic material into host organisms of virtually any living species—including humans. A Genestealer is \ncapable of using the same telepathy that links a brood of the horrific xenos together to dominate the mind of a being \ninfected by its genetic material. When this victim reproduces with its own species, the offspring is a twisted hybrid of \nTyranid and host bio-seed. These hybrids eventually interbreed and birth purestrain Genestealers as the course of this \nbizarre species’ reproductive cycle.\nOnce the Kill-team realises what they face, the players are bound to have a few questions about certain mechanics.\nBeCoMing a hoSt\nA Space Marine’s superior physiology added to special Deathwatch treatments makes him immune to the Genestealers’ \ninfection, but to others, it possesses a great risk. This change is not instantaneous; the character does not turn on his \nallies in the next Round. The exact pace at which a host becomes subverted to the alien will is left up to the GM. Anyone \nwithin the aura of the Virtue psychic power gains +20 to his Toughness Test to avoid being infected by a Genestealer’s \nbite. See the Genestealer profile on page 47 for the exact mechanics of the bite.\ndeteCting infeCtion\nAn Auspex, Diagnostor Helm, or similar augury instrument must be used to determine if a person has become infected \nby a Genestealer. A character using one of these devices makes a Difficult (–10) Medicae Test to determine if the \npatient is infected. Two or more Degrees of Success with the Reading psychic power also gives this information. The \nGM should roll all detection Tests in secret so that the players do not know whether they passed or failed, as a failed \nTest always yields a clean reading.\nCuring infeCtion\nObscure and arduous medical procedures—known by many Apothecaries and members of the Ordo Xenos—exist to \nremove the taint of a Genestealer. However, this requires an extremely skilled practitioner of the healing arts working in \nadvanced medicae facilities. After a week of gruelling scans, operations, and genetic scouring, the medicae may attempt \na Very Hard (–30) Medicae Test to see if the treatment has been effective.\n35\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nBarriCadeS\nYears ago the last untainted citizens of Grensvayl made their \nstand just west of the river bed, where they had a clear line \nof sight in most directions. This resistance is no more. Their \nmakeshift defences—built of bone, ploughs, and even talons \nand chitin from the enemy—crumble as a testament to the \nvictory of the xenos.\nAPOSTATE cAVERNS\nThese natural caverns, adjacent to a rich node of Decavane \ncrystals, were the source of Grensvayl’s doom. Samech’s \napostate Mechanicus landed here over a decade ago, \nexpanding the natural cave system for their mining operation, \nand seeding the deadly Genestealers as cover for their work. \nRead aloud or paraphrase the following when the Battle-\nBrothers near the western cliffs:\nAs you near the western edge of the settlement, you can see \nimmediately that there is something unnatural set into the cliff \nwall. A shock of twisted, corroded metal mars this world of plants \nand stone. Looking closer, you see that fragments of artificial \nrock face still cling to what appears to be a mangled bulkhead \ndoor. Larger chunks of this shattered veneer lie in rubble nearby. \nOnce, this hatch might have been well hidden, but now it is just \nas ruined as the surrounding town.\nCavern entranCe\nOriginally built for secrecy, the entrance to the caverns now \nstands out starkly against the cliffs. The stone camouflage \nmay have been enough to deceive the natives, but the very \npredators the Magi introduced became their undoing. The \nrent entry testifies to the price of the apostates’ false sense   \nof security. \nthe Mining ChaMBer\nThose who assume Genestealers are merely animals often \nfind it is the last mistake they ever make. The creatures are \nquite intelligent, particularly Broodlords. Furthermore, they \npass a sort of racial memory to their offspring. In the case \nof Grensvayl, even though recent generations of Genestealers \nhave been born in an isolated feral settlement with none \nbut their own alien kin to learn from, some of the recent \ninfected warriors still have a loose grasp of technology. They \nknow that the Tech-priests’ possessions hold some kind of \npower, but do not understand how to use them. A small \ngroup of infected warriors has taken up residence in the \nmining chamber, determined to discover the secrets of the   \nmysterious machines.\nThe mining chamber is by far the largest section of the \ncaves. Dormant drilling lasers, extraction bits, and complex \nstorage arrays line the walls of the large room. The complex \nstructure of a Decavane crystal is notoriously fragile, and it \nmust be removed from its natural environment with great \nthe Shape of thingS to CoMe\nIn the Apostate Caverns, the Battle-Brothers \nencounter many important links to the greater story \nof the emperor protects. For cohesion in the \nGM’s mind, here is an overview of how these pieces \nfit together.\nlinkS to the other MiSSionS\nIn order to subvert the warp gate, Dahzak and the \nVinculum Proselytes must first be able to get to it. \nMagos Vayze devised a way to use spent Decavane \ncrystals to absorb the same great quantities of energy \nthey can emit. While the Irradial Forge certainly \nhas more traditional uses for Decavane as a power \nsource, its role as an energy sink is what makes it \nvital to the Ruin Bringer.\nCreating original MiSSionS\nThere is no set amount of time that has to pass between \nany of the Missions in the emperor protects. You \ncan run interim Missions or use the pre-written \nones back to back. Another possibility is to create \nmore Missions that fit in with the overall story. The \nSword of Vigilance opens with an overview of all \nthe information that must be assembled to guess \nwhat the forces of Chaos are plotting. the emperor \nprotects could easily become several more Missions \nif you feed those clues to the Kill-team one at a time. \nPresented here are some ideas if you want to devise \nyour own interim Missions.\nUse the Radial of Chaos as a Link. All three \nMissions in the Emperor Protects point to the \nVinculum Proselytes—specifically their symbol \nand Magi—as a common factor. Using those same \nelements in other operations makes it clear that they \nare part of the same story. You could also allow \nthe Kill-team to learn more about the Vinculum \nProselytes and their blasphemous mixture of \ntechnology and sorcery prior to the final Mission.\nEncounter Lamdus Rize and the Alpha Legion. \nDahzak allied with the Alpha Legion for a reason: \nthere is much to be done before the operation \ncan launch. In the background, Lamdus and his \nmen are in engaging in many preparatory military \nactions such a sabotaging key relays to make the \nRuin Bringer’s passage easier. The Battle-Brothers \nmight encounter them in this context before A   \nStony Sleep.\nPresent Dahzak earlier. Defeating a villain can \nbe even more satisfying if the protagonists first \nbuild up antipathy for him. The vector amplifier in \nA Stony Sleep is not the first, and may not be the \nlast piece of arcane technology Dahzak pursues. He \ncould potentially build up a long enmity with the \nBattle-Brothers before they finally defeat him.\n36\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\ncare before being refined into a power source. The mining \nequipment was all designed for this delicate, arduous process. \nThe huge central drilling column occupies the heart of the \nchamber, obscuring the infected warriors lying in wait on the \nother side. As makeshift weapons, none of the tools available \ncompare to a Space Marine’s armament. However, should it \nbecome relevant, assume a laser drill counts as a lasgun, and an \nextraction bit can be removed and used as a combat knife.\nArrows of Light\nOperating the complex equipment in the chamber is beyond \neven the average Imperial citizens. Xenos-dominated feral \nworlders stood little chance of puzzling it out. All the same, \nthrough trial and error (and not a few deadly accidents) they \ndiscovered the machinery in the cavern can be used as a \nweapon. When the Space Marines enter the cavern, they can \nmake an Awareness Test opposed by the warriors’ Silent Move. \nBattle-Brothers who succeed hear the warriors scrambling \namongst the machines in time to avoid being Surprised.\nThe infected warriors touch the correct wires together, and \nthe forward part of the chamber fills with arcing energy. This \nenergy has the same Damage and Penetration as a Meltagun. \nAlthough the attack does not have the Flame property, treat \nit in the same manner for purposes of avoidance: the feral \nworlders do not roll to hit. Instead, the Battle-Brothers \nmake an Agility Test to avoid taking damage. The three men \nhunker down behind the blocky energy coils and drill banks \n50 metres away. This gives them virtually complete cover \nwith an AP of 30. Once they are dispatched and the crystal \nassemblies stop emitting electrical pulses, the Space Marines \ncan get a better look at the area.\ncrystal Processing\nThe source of the deadly energy is a large web of Decavane \ncrystals linked to directional electrodes. They do not appear \nto be powering anything, and an Ordinary (+10) Tech Use \nTest confirms that the assembly’s only purpose seems to be to \nemit large bursts of power from the crystals. Beside the array \nis a large stack of dull, grey crystals that have been completely \ndrained in this manner. They are cold to the touch.\nThe room also contains a refining cylinder (identifiable \nwith a successful Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test). This \nmore traditional equipment bombards the Decavane with \nphotons until it is stable enough to pack and transport. This \ndevice and the amount of crystal beside it are much smaller \nthan the emitter web and its expended fuel.\nThe Mining Shaft\nThe apostates have left a huge hole in the stone beneath the \ndrill. It is several metres across and extends twenty meters \ndown. If anyone descends, they see an even larger hollow \ncreated by years of mining. Judging by the amount of rock \nremoved and the density of crystal still remaining in the walls, \nit possible that thousands of kilos of crystal may have been \nextracted. The total quantity of crystals, drained and refined, \nin the rest of the complex is only a slight fraction of what this \nmine appears to have provided.\nThe GM may also want to reward anyone who takes \nthe trouble to scan or climb down to this level by having a \nlone Infected Warrior or Genestealer hiding in the darkness. \nThis justifies their diligence in searching every corner of \nthe settlement to be sure they cleansed it completely. (If the \nKill-team doesn’t thoroughly investigate, the GM can decide \nwhether that has ramifications or not.)\nSouth Cave\nThe apostates used the cave south of the entrance as their \nliving quarters. It contains overturned cots and a scattered pile \nof broken cogs, all liberally stained with old blood. The cogs’ \narrangement suggests the echo of the grotesque machine they \nonce formed, leaving little doubt that the chamber is better \noff in its damaged state. Several of the ruined components are \netched with the symbol of a cog inside an eight-pointed chaos \nstar. (The Radial of Chaos, which is not a known symbol.) \nTwo of the slaughtered machine cultists have been dragged \naway, but the body of the most mechanised of the cabal was \nleft behind. It takes a moment to recognise the pile of tubes, \ndeCiphering the SCheMatiCS\nThe unidentifiable designs in the transport chamber \nare for Thaumagramm Diodes, the corruptive \ntechnology which is the cornerstone of Dahzak’s plan. \nWhile finding these schematics is not crucial to the \nemperor protects, it does provide a way for the \nplayer characters to start assembling the clues that link \nthe Missions together. The primary skill involved in \nunderstanding what the diagrams depict is Tech-Use. \nHowever, Forbidden Lore (Warp) is also essential to \ncompleting the picture.\nIf the group has a Techmarine who shows an interest \nin unravelling this mystery, let him lead the efforts to \nunderstand what they have discovered (possibly in \nconcert with a member of the Inquisition if he lacks the \nForbidden Lore component). If the group does not have \nsuch a character, an NPC can carry on the research in \nthe background on Erioch, reporting his various stages \nof progress to the player characters. Below are some \nrevelations you can slowly release at the appropriate \npace (possibly beginning in the Transport Chamber if \na Techmarine examines the diagrams there).\n•The schematics are for a relatively small device, but \nit requires a potent power source. This is almost \ncertainly why they needed the Decavane.\n•The device uses a forbidden fusion of the arts \nof technology and warp sorcery. Furthermore, it \nseems made to interact with other creations that \nhave similar properties.\n•The principles of the design have certain patterns in \ncommon with teleportation technology. Something \nin the flow of powers depicted relates to time and \nspace manipulation.\n•The schematic is for some sort of oscillation device \nthat transforms or alters the flow of energy.\n37\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\ncoils, and manipulators as the remains of a living being. He \nwas too much metal and not enough flesh to be of interest \nto the Genestealers, and so they picked what little sustenance \nthey could from his frame and left the rest to rust. A successful \nOrdinary (+10) Common Lore: Jericho Reach Test \nrecognises the characteristics of one of Samech’s apostate \nMechanicus Magi.\ntranSport ChaMBer\nThe apostates brought the planet’s doom with them in \nstasis along with equipment and drills. Their most precious, \ndangerous cargo was a captured Genestealer from Samech’s \ninfamous stock of “specimens.” Its vacant transport tube still \nsits in this cavern, deceptively innocuous amidst the various \nother refuse of their endeavour. \nA large, plasteel cylinder sits among the debris, covered in a thick \nlayer of grime. Lifeless bio-monitoring screens checker the stasis \ntube, and a six-shackled adamantite restraint harness lies beside it.\nWhile the other contents are largely empty crates and \nbroken tools, an Ordinary (+10) Search Test finds a stack \nof parchment schematics and drained data-slates. Some of \nthe schematics depict the mining array in the main chamber. \nHowever, a few of the schematics depict... something else. Read \naloud or paraphrase the following if they are examined:\nThe durable parchment and rich inks have survived the years \nof dirt and dankness well. This was obviously an important \ndocument scribed with care. The main diagram shows an \noctagonal crystal conduit of indeterminate size. Several notations \nand sub-diagrams detail runes and complex circuit patterns \nilluminated on the device.\nA Routine (+20) Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test can \nidentify the runes as the markings of sorcery.\nviCtory\nWhen the Kill-team has cleared the town, their easiest exit \nstrategy is to vox the Thunderhawk for extraction from the \nring of fire. However, they are certainly free to make more \ndramatic exits such as blasting open the rubble sealing \nthe ravine, sending the dammed river cascading back   \nthrough Grensvayl.\nwhere iS the Broodlord?\nDepending on how much the characters and/or \nplayers know about Tyranids, they may be aware \nthat the pinnacle of Genestealer evolution is a deadly \nand psychic creature called the Broodlord, and that \nBroodlords are often found at the head of infestations \nsuch as Grensvayl’s. This knowledge might convince \nsome that their Mission is not over until they have slain \nthe Broodlord (and they would be right). However, the \ncreature is no longer in the settlement.\nIf the characters are focused on this creature, the \nGM can take the opportunity to remind (or reveal to) \nthem that a Broodlord did emerge just a few years ago, \nand was thought killed. (See A Tireless Foe on page \n32.) Alternatively, he certainly can re-arrange events \nto confront the Broodlord and infiltrators in Haistand \nbefore the celebration—a feast which is bound to go \nfar smoother without the catastrophic interruption! \nHowever, the characters (not just the players) should \nhave a good reason to believe that such a creature is still \nalive before proceeding down that route.\n38\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe Heroes’ \nReturn\n“To inspire is our duty as surely as battle. We know too well the \nhorrors that assault men’s souls every day. With hope and with faith, \nwe guard those souls just as with blade and bolter we guard their \nbodies.”\n–attributed to Roboute Guilliman\nI\nf all has gone well, the Kill-team returns apparently \ntriumphant. That evening, Rylus meets them on the roof \nagain to discuss the future of the Imperium on Aurum. \nRead aloud or paraphrase the following:\nAs you emerge into the dry evening air, the sun is setting. It streaks \nthe golden sky with a rich sheen of bold crimson and warm \norange, making the luminous heavens look like a great mural \nof the planet’s namesake metal. The Caele faces the horizon, but \nhe turns as he hears you approach. With the halo of the gold \nsunset behind him, the tall warrior could have stepped out of  \na painting.\nHis face smiles, but his eyes are grave and joyless as he greets \nyou. “I am humbled. You have accomplished what my people \ncould not, and cleansed us of the shame of this taint. Alkedre \nis already preparing arrangements for your victory feast. I hope \nyou will indulge us this one last Auran tradition.” Even the \nforced smile fades. “I think we will see fewer and fewer of them \nin the years to come. Do you still wish us to join with—to return \nto—your Imperium?”\nThe Caele requires little convincing (assuming the Battle-\nBrothers are still behind this part of their Mission). He knows \nthey have saved his planet from a threat he could not, and is \nmore or less honour-bound to accept their request. However, \nhe offers one last alternative.\n“Will you at least consider another option? You could tell the \nImperium that the Gene Stealers had planted their roots too deep. \nTell them that our world is doomed, and that your people must \nflee it for their own safety. The ancient soul of Aurum tells me \nthat the Crusade will not be kind to our people. How long before \nwe become only farm labourers for your armies? Until all that \nmakes this planet glow is stripped away? For years the Aspirance \nhas preached that death will soon come to Aurum if their armies \ndo not stop it, and this may be true. But our warriors would \ngladly fill the war grounds to lay down their lives against an \nenemy. They will not find such peace in servitude.”\nHe sighs, and looks over you and your Battle-Brothers. “I \nhave never seen warriors that are your equal, and your vision \nstretches even beyond the stars of Aurum. Give me your counsel, \nand I will follow it.”\nRylus accepts whatever recommendation the Kill-team \nmakes. If the Battle-Brothers are at odds with one another, \nuse Charm Tests to determine whose influence reigns. Charm \nor Logic Tests may also be used to make Rylus feel more \nconfident about a decision that involves Imperium control of \nAurum. Regardless of the decision they lead him to, he insists \non holding their victory feast before they leave. However, the \nmood the Battle-Brothers leave Rylus in certainly shades his \ndemeanour through the rest of the adventure.\nA DAY FOR cELEBRATION\nThe festivities are scheduled to start just before midday, and \nAlkedre has requested that the Battle-Brothers arrive at the \nhomestead slightly earlier to prepare. Most Space Marines \nunderstand the importance of ceremony, but if by chance any \n(or all) of the Space Marines decide not to attend their own \nvictory celebration, it carries on without them in absentia. \nDiaz Lan still has a duty to solidify relations with the planet, \nso he has no intention of leaving orbit without attending this \nmonumental step in gaining their acceptance. This leaves the \nBattle-Brothers with the morning to follow up on loose ends, \nif they so desire.\nthe eneMy within\nDepending on whether they spoke with the war party \nsurvivors in Grensvayl and other clues, the Battle-Brothers \nmay have deduced that something is wrong with Karthas. \nIf they bring their suspicions to the Caele’s attention, he \nimmediately arranges a meeting for them, although he is slow \nto believe any accusations. Alternatively, if Karthas is not with \nthe Caele or at the promethium pits, he may be found in \nhis home north of the commerce aisles. His pregnant wife, \nLeyann, is present there. At first the Broodlord dwelt beneath \ntheir home, recovering from the grave burns it received in its \nlast escape attempt. Once it healed, the city den proved ideal \nfor spreading its genetic taint through the population.\noptional enCounter: \noffended honour\nDepending on the Battle-Brothers’ actions, Zayr has any \nnumber of reasons to feel that they have trampled his \npride. They may have dishonoured him by uncovering \nthe promethium pits, or the Auran culture by refusing the \nDivested Hunt, or just shamed him personally by succeeding \nin Grensvayl where Zayr’s men had failed. If Zayr feels \nsufficiently humiliated, he challenges the Battle-Brothers by \nsplitting the rock of grievance.\nSplitting the Rock of Grievance: This ritual begins by \npresenting the other party with two pieces of a quartered \nstone. Each man then uses their pieces to delineate two corners \nof the boundary in which they will fight. Most combats are \nto the first blood (a hit that does 3 or more Wounds), but \nthe victor always has the option to shatter the loser’s skull. \nThe skull is then also quartered and left by each of the stone \nmarkers for one week. \n39\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe encounter opens when Zayr approaches the Battle-\nBrothers and wordlessly drops two pieces of stone before \nthem. Even if they don’t understand the significance, everyone \naround them seems to. A crowd immediately forms, whispering \nand keeping their distance. Either an onlooker or Zayr himself \nexplains about splitting the rock of grievance. Of course, \nnothing forces the Battle-Brothers to accept the challenge. If \nthey refuse, Zayr denounces them before the onlookers:\n“These are the most noble warriors of the off-worlders?! So great \nthat they run from a challenge? Truly your people are cowards \nwith no sense of honour. You may have Rylus fooled, but you \nshow your true face now.”\nUnless one of the Battle-Brothers makes a speech which \nsways the crowd in their favour (a difficult task), refusing the \nchallenge lowers the Kill-team’s standing in the eyes of the \nnatives considerably. They are a far less enthusiastic audience at \nany ensuing public events, and the Battle-Brothers are likely to \nhear murmurs of “coward” in nearby crowds for the duration of \ntheir stay in Haistand.\nIf they do accept, the combat must be one on one. The Kill-\nteam needs to select a participant (it does not necessarily have \nto be the Leader). The only stipulation is that he may not use \nranged weapons. Unlike the Divested Hunt, no one pressures him \nto remove his armour or advanced weapons. However, he might \nchoose to do so of his own accord, given that his opponent has \nonly scale armour and primitive bone gyrblades.\nThe crowd is respectfully silent during the ritual and shows no \nfavouritism. After the rocks are placed, everyone makes room and \nthe combat begins. Power armour or no, the odds are incredibly \nstacked against Zayr. This combat is more about how the Battle-\nBrother chooses to treat his stubborn and outmatched opponent. \nDoes he wear his power armour? Does he pull his strikes—which \nmight otherwise kill the Auran outright? Does he opt to finish \nZayr off? If by some fluke Zayr does win, his pride is sated and \nhe does not make good on the option to quarter his opponent’s \nskull. (This is probably fortunate for him, as he would have a \nhard time cracking a Space Marine’s skull.)\nthe viCtory feaSt\nThe Battle-Brothers who arrive at the Caele’s homestead as \nrequested are met by Alkedre. She attempts to deck each of \nthem in a necklace displaying the fangs of the Diablodon and \nthreaded with a few of its distinctive scales. (If they brought back \na sizable portion of the creature, she may even present one of \nthem with a fiery red scale cape; if they spurned the Divested \nHunt then obviously no trophies are involved.) Diaz Lan and \nBrigadier Heth are present as well in dress uniforms. They have \nbeen invited to accompany the small procession.\nShortly before the sun reaches its peak, the procession sets out, \nwalking the main thoroughfare between the Caele’s homestead \nand the Hall of Victory. Rylus and the Battle-Brothers are at the \nhead of the line, flanked by roughly a dozen of the Caele’s most \nfavoured warriors (this includes Heydal and Karthas if he has \nnot been dealt with). Behind them trail Alkedre and four Aurans \ncarrying a raised platform on their shoulders—a monument \nto the Battle-Brothers’ victory. On it is splayed the mangled \nremains of a Genestealer from the ruin of Grensvayl. The creature \nis ritually impaled on a number of intersecting spears. Read or \nparaphrase the following for anyone present:\nThe Aurans have turned out in force to celebrate your victory. \nFrom the moment you exit the Caele’s gates you see them lining \nthe streets and throning close around the procession. The change \nin their demeanour is dramatic. Everywhere you turn the tanned \nfaces are grinning and cheering—their weapons waved aloft in \nsalute, their ululations of celebration ringing through the city.\nEveryone’s mood is joyful. The Aurans are rid of a great \nand shameful threat; the Imperium has finally won respect \nin the eyes of the natives. The group slowly makes its way \ntowards the Hall. Large bonfires—fuelled with bundles of \nplains grass—burn a scintillating golden orange around the \namphitheatre in front of the Hall. The monument-bearers set \nthe Genestealer corpse at the centre of the stone stage as the \nboisterous crowd files into the rows. Rylus climbs to the stage \nplatform, and beckons the Battle-Brothers to join him. Read \nor paraphrase the following:\nRylus steps forward to stand beside the gruesome display. He raises \none hand, and the crowd falls silent. “My people, as I look in your \nfaces, I can see you know that today is a great day. By this act of \nbravery by the Imperium’s warriors, by these Adeptus Astartes, \nour lives are changed forever.” He gestures at the monument. “For \nmore than a decade these monsters have threatened our planet, as \nthe Imperium’s speakers have tried to tell us they threaten the lives \nof all men. We would not listen.” He turns to Brigadier Heth, and \nthen to the Battle-Brothers. “Whatever else may come, we hear you \nnow. Whatever other rocks of grievance we may split, the ancient \nSpirit of Aurum knows you as noble warriors.”\nfollowing up in the BlaCk \ndepthS\nIt is possible the Battle-Brothers may decide to investigate \nthe promethium wells after making peace with the Caele. \nIn this case the GM has a few options. He may decide to \nreward their diligence by letting them discover and purge \nthe creatures at the wells. The Broodlord could appear \nalone at Lan’s shuttle, in the Caele’s residence, or not at \nall—yielding a less eventful but more celebratory feast. \nAlternatively their venture to the black depths could begin \none of the scenarios in Missing the Party on page 41.\nIf the hiding Genestealers remain undiscovered, they \ndo not leave the wells until the celebration begins and \nHaistand’s guard is down. There is no sign of them in the \ncapital prior to the celebration, but see Missing the Party.\n40\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe crowd erupts into cheers, which Rylus allows to \ncontinue for a time. Anywhere that Aurans are near Imperial \nrepresentatives such as the Missionaries or Guardsmen, they \ncan be seen heartily thumping the off-worlders’ shoulders \nwith their weapon hilts. As the exultation dies down, the \nCaele continues. Depending on how the Kill-team guided \nhim, he goes on to announce his intentions for the future of \nthe Imperium and the planet. If the Battle-Brothers agreed to \nhis proposal, he is ambiguous about his intent, expecting the \nsituation to resolve itself when the Kill-team makes its report.\nThen, Rylus turns to the Battle-Brothers and indicates for \nthem to address the crowd. The Kill-team may be surprised \nby this turn of events, but it is Auran tradition for warriors \nto address their fellows when being honoured. The Caele \nis encouraging but not insistent. Allow any character that is \nwilling a chance to address the crowd. Unless they declined \nZayr’s challenge the audience is friendly and receptive. Use \nInteraction Tests only as a fallback for players who aren’t sure \nwhat their character would say, or as an option for anyone \nwho would like chance to dictate whether they provoke an \nexceptional reaction (positive or negative).\nThe celebration moves into the Hall of Victory after the \npublic address. Read aloud or paraphrase the following:\nThe warm Auran sun filters in through the high windows, bathing \nthe feast hall in warm gold light. Several long tables have been \nprepared with the hospitable planet’s bounty. Dozens of varieties \nof sliced fruit and baked grains surround centrepieces of whole, \nroasted argrax and platters of basted midasaur ribs. Pitchers of \nhandfruit nectar and fermented red sap are availablee. As the \nchosen attendees file in, small emerald lizards assemble around \nthem to beg for table scraps.\nThe Hall is large, but it cannot possibly hold the entire city’s \npopulation. After the main procession enters, the Aurans by \nthe door appear to be holding an impromptu blade-throwing \ncontest for the right to enter. Eventually the winners filter in \nto occupy the empty benches, grinning and cheering at their \nguests. Most of Haistand’s NPCs are present, seated around the \nhall. The Battle-Brothers are free to join the feasting wherever \nthey desire. Available tables and conversation include:\nThe Caele’s Table: The Aurans’ pensive leader answers his \npeople’s questions about the Imperium and the Space Marines. \nIf he spots the Battle-Brothers, he tries to gesture one over to \nanswer their inquiries first-hand. Possible questions include:\n•Have they ever fought anything more fearsome than the \nGenestealers, and what was it?\n•How do the Space Marines move in such heavy armour? \nDepending on how it is explained, one of the Aurans \nmay follow the explanation with a request to try the   \narmour on.\n•Why are the Space Marines so much bigger than the other \nImperials?\nHeth and Alkedre’s Table: The Brigadier and the Sinsir are \ndiscussing life in the Imperial Guard. Heth gives a glory-filled \nrecruitment speech straight out of the Imperial Infantryman’s \nUplifting Primer. Alkedre seems quite impressed by the vision \npresented. However, in parallel with their discussion, the two \nGuardsman who accompanied Heth appear to be growing \nenamoured with the Auran warriors’ description of their   \ntribal life.\nMiSSing the party\nIndividual Chapters and even individual warriors have \ntheir own ideas about what is within the bounds of \ntheir duty, and what is acceptable to their honour. What \nif some (or all) of the Battle-Brothers refuse to attend \nthe ceremony, or are not invited because of strife with \nthe Aurans? In this case you will still want to draw \nthe absent characters towards the climactic action. \nThis final confrontation can either be in the Hall of \nVictory as written, or the Combat Sites from that fight \ncan be spread across the city to represent the breaking \npandemonium.\nOne way to do this is to let them suddenly discover \nthat the Genestealer threat is not as cleansed as the \nCaele would like to believe. The most interesting way \nto do this depends on what they have decided to do \nwhile the victory feast goes on. Some options include:\n•If they are out in the city, a Challenging (+0) \nAwareness Test may spot the brood trying to creep \nthrough the low grasses from the North into the \ncity. The Battle-Brothers reach the intruding aliens \njust as they finish scaling the northeast cliff and \ncharge into the Hall of Victories.\n•If the Kill-team has not dealt with Karthas, throw \nthem a lead towards his home. There, the Kill-team \ndiscovers a hidden cellar where human and reptilian \nbones show that something with a prodigious \nappetite has been hiding. The room smells faintly \nof promethium. Worse yet, a fresh set of clawed \ntracks lead out of the cellar, and towards the Hall.\n•A bloody, exhausted escapee from the promethium \nwell stumbles into town. It may be chance that the \nBattle-Brothers are the first people to spot him, \nor if they spoke with the prisoners he may have \nsought them out deliberately. He relays a chilling \nstory of monsters rising out of the flooded caverns \nand ripping their way through the inmates on their \nway towards Haistand. \nthe Slaughter in wartiMe\nJust because the Battle-Brothers and the Aurans may \nbe at war instead of feasting together doesn’t mean the \nremainder of the Genestealer brood has gone away. If \nrelations with the natives turn bloody and are never \nmended, Lan and a handful of men come to the surface \nto rescue the remaining Imperials. When this happens, \nthe Genestealers seize their chance to try infecting him. \nThe combats set in the Hall can easily be modified to \ncreate a series of fights scattered across Haistand.\n41\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nFather Marius’s Table: The Missionary is telling the story of \nhow the Emperor re-gathered the scattered Primarchs to him. \nHe is on the three challenges of Leman Russ if a Battle-Brother \napproaches, and it looks like the Aurans might be considering \nre-enacting one or more of the tests. Unless egged on they \nsettle for emulating one or both of the first two challenges; \neating or drinking (as opposed to a combat challenge).\n•If any of the Battle-Brothers participate in a drinking \nchallenge, it can be represented by opposed Carouse \nTests. Battle-Brothers gain a +10 to this Test from their \nPreomnor.\n•Eating competitions can be represented by opposed \nToughness Tests. Space Marines gain no additional benefits \nbeyond their Unnatural Toughness.\nHeydal and Lan’s Table: Heydal has finally been relieved of \nhis trying sentry duty. The Rogue Trader coaxes information \nabout the Genestealers out of him, while Heydal seems \nperplexed and fascinated by the concept of currency, something \nforeign to their barter economy.\nThe Last Table: The occupants of the last table depend on \nthe actions the Battle-Brothers have taken. If they saved any of \nthe warriors in the lodge, then they occupy the table, recounting \ntheir tale of survival in Grensvayl. Otherwise, if they have not \ndealt with Karthas, he and three recently infected warriors sit \nin a cluster of unsuspecting Aurans.\nAfter sufficient roleplaying to establish what everyone is \ndoing at the feast, have each character make an Ordinary \n(+10) Awareness Test. Those who pass hear a distinctive \nshrieking hiss over the clamour of the hall, and may act \nimmediately. (Those who failed are sure to notice the resulting \nactivity and can act on the following round.) Read or paraphrase   \nthe following:\nThe Genestealers’ appearance in the hall is so sudden that they \nseem to have materialised, like a discordant element of a dream—\nor a nightmare. Many of the creatures are stained black, and drip \nviscous crude promethium. There is no moment of posturing, and \nno time for their victims to scream. The first Aurans cut down \nnever even see what murdered them. They die with cups in hand, \nsmiles on their lips. The next few are not so fortunate. They have \njust enough time to begin reaching for their weapons. They die \nwith the reflections of the xenos monsters in their dead eyes. \nAt the head of this teeming brood is a monster larger and \nmore hideous than the rest. It towers above its smaller kin, every \nmidnight plate ridged with protrusions, and a wicked intelligence \ngleaming in its malicious eyes. The Broodlord leaps towards the \nCaele’s table as its chitinous minions progress down the banquet \nlaid out for them.\ncELEBRATION TURNED TO \nSLAUGHTER\nThe feast hall is quickly overtaken by carnage. The entire \nbuilding is a frenzy of battle, but a distinct fight breaks out \naround each of the tables. Each Battle-Brother may choose to \nstay where he was, or spend a Round moving from one table \nto another. Because friend and foe are densely intermixed \nin the hall, the GM should strongly consider using the \noptional rule on page 248 of the Deathwatch Rulebook  for \nStray Shots.\nIt is important to note that this is not a random attack by \nmindless animals. Genestealers are far more intelligent and \ncunning than many give them credit for. The assault on the \nhall has a specific purpose and target: to infect the Rogue \nTrader Diaz Lan. Like all Tyranid creatures, if Genestealers \nremain through a Hive’s consumption of a planet, they are \nultimately re-absorbed into the Fleet’s pool of biomatter. \nThe drive to avoid this fate is the very trait that makes \nGenestealers effective vanguard organisms. They are driven \nto flee ever further from the oncoming Hive Fleet, infecting \nand destabilizing more planets as they go.\nBeing on the border of the Orpheus Salient, Aurum is close \nenough to the oncoming Fleet that the Genestealers’ instinct \nto move onward is paramount. A Rogue Trader is the perfect \nhost for these creatures. Once loyal to the brood, his human \nseeming, his ship, and his unusual freedom of passage could \ncarry the Genestealers to hundreds of distant worlds given \nenough time. The feast represents the first time Lan has been \nto the planet since the Broodlord’s escape. All other bloodshed \nin the Hall is a distraction, a decoy meant to pull attention \naway from Lan so that he can be implanted without notice.\n42\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nThe caele’s Table\nNaturally, Rylus immediately leaps to the front of the Auran \nranks. The scarred Broodlord’s psychic abilities and combat \nprowess threaten to quickly cut through the Caele’s men \nand leave him overwhelmed through sheer numbers alone. \nWhen rolling for sideline combat results for this combat \nsite, both sides gain +10 to their Opposed Test as long as \ntheir respective leader (Rylus or the Broodlord) remains to   \nlead them.\nHeth and Alkedre’s Table\nTwo dichotomous combat styles are evident in this combat. \nHeth and his two guardsmen have flipped over a long table \nand fire from behind it. The Aurans form an outnumbered \nfront line, trying to hold the deadly taloned creatures back \nfrom the Guardsmen while not obstructing their shots. \nBecause of the Aurans’ defensive tactics and their alertness \nto friendly fire, the rules for Stray Shots do not apply here, \nand characters firing into the melee suffer only a –10 penalty \ninstead of the usual –20.\nFather Marius’s Table\nHowever slow the Aurans may be to accept Father Marius’s \nteachings, they leap to defend him from the xenos as if he was \none of their own. Father Marius is a loyal servant of the God-\nEmperor and does anything but cower. He bellows words of \nthe Emperor’s wrath at the oncoming horde. The Aurans form \nthe front line against the Genestealers, and Marius scorches \nany of the creatures that threaten to overwhelm them with \nhis holy flamer—which is particularly effective against the \npromethium-spattered creatures. This section of the hall \ncrackles with flame in short order.\nHeydal and Lan’s Table\nThe brood cunningly assaults this location with a smaller \nforce, creating the appearance that the Heydal and Lan are \nholding their own without assistance. The false purpose of \ntheir attack is represented by the lower Weapon Skill at this \nlocation. If Karthas is present at the feast, he further aids this \ndeception. Every Round that this centre is in Combat, in \naddition to assessing casualties, make an additional Opposed \nTest between the Genestealers’ effective Weapon Skill \nof 55 and Lan’s Dodge of 44. If Lan fails, he must pass a \nToughness Test or become infected as per the Genestealer’s \nKiss mechanic. \nAny character fighting at this combat site or who spends \nan Action that includes observing it can make a Challenging \n(+0) Scrutiny Test. If he succeeds, he notices that the \nGenestealers seem to be attacking with less fury here and \nare centring their efforts on Lan. If Karthas and his warriors \nare present to give the illusion of a greater struggle, this test \nbecomes Difficult (–10), but if passed also reveals the warriors \nwho are only feigning combat. \nfroM the BlaCk depthS\nThe Genestealers have been hiding in the promethium \nwells, hence the reason for their splotchy coats of \nthe substance. However, being covered in fuel is \nparticularly disadvantageous if facing foes that wield \nfire. The Genestealers automatically fail any Tests to \navoid catching on fire, and take 2 additional points \nof damage per round from fire and weapons with the \nFlame Quality. Note that the Broodlord was not in the \npits and thus this rule does not apply to it.\nrunning the viCtory hall \nfight\nThere is a lot of activity in the hall during this scene. It \ncan be easy to get overwhelmed or sidetracked with all the \nenemies and NPC’s involved. The GM can use one simple \nrule to keep the fight manageable and interesting: keep the \nfocus on the player character point of view. Track the total \nnumber of Rounds since the fight began, but stick to only \nto rolling for sideline combats when a Battle-Brother takes \ntime to assess it, when he enters the combat, or at the end \nof the fight when you need to know the final outcomes. \nA character can take a Half Action to assess the situation \nof one other combat, or a Full Action to assess the entire \nroom. The maelstrom of clashing steel and claws is too \ndangerous and frantic to distil meaning from quick glances \nwhile defending oneself.\nSideline CoMBatS\nA sideline combat is any combat where a player character is \nnot participating. Each combat site has a specified number \nof allies and Genestealers present. The prowess of the \nindividuals at each site is abstracted into a single Combat \nSkill for that site. The profile for each site can be found on \nTable 1–3: Combat Sites (see page 45). Whenever you \nneed to assess a sideline combat, roll an Opposed Test of the \nsite’s Combat Skill vs. Genestealer Weapon Skill for every \nRound they have been in sideline combat. Each degree of \nsuccess indicates one death in the opposing ranks. When \nthe number of one side reaches 0, they have been wiped \nout. Assume that named NPCs are always the last to die in \na group of allies.\nplayer CoMBatS\nBecause NPC’s are present (at least to begin with) at most \nof the other tables, the same principle applies to fights \nwhere the Space Marines are involved: keep the focus \non the player character(s). Simply put, assume the heroic \npresence of a Battle-Brother turns the tide of the battle at \nany combat site where he is engaged. As long as a Battle-\nBrother is actively fighting at a site, his allies are collectively \nable to diminish the Genestealers’ numbers by one each \nTurn (in addition to any the Battle-Brother kills).\nIf the GM prefers not to leave the combat outcomes up to \nchance and to instead determine the outcomes narratively, \nhe may find it useful to make notes of how each combat \nshould go—with assistance and without—ahead of time.\n43\n\nI \n:\n The Price of Hubris\nwHAT REMAINS?\nAt last the flames receded, and I saw the ruin of all that I had once \ntreasured. As the ashes ran between my fingers, I could not recall \nwhat had possibly been worth this price.\n–Author Unknown, from document fragments recovered in \nthe Black Reef\nWhen the combat finally subsides, the Hall of Victory is \nstrewn with alien corpses and dead Aurans. The GM assesses \nthe final outcomes of any sideline combats, and determines \nwho is still standing. In addition to the specific case of Lan, he \nshould also decide how many Aurans have become infected \nand if this fate befell any other important NPC’s. Brigadier \nHeth knows enough to report if he has been bitten, and Lan \nknows enough to hide it, but all of the other NPC’s have no \nnotion that a stray bite is even of concern unless the Battle-\nBrothers tell them.\nLan’s ship has the medical facilities to treat one person \ninfected by a Genestealer, but no medicae skilled in doing \nso (which means this is only a viable option if the Kill-team \nhas an Apothecary). It also has no stasis tubes large enough \nto hold a person, although a Battle-Brother might think to \nretrieve and repair the tube in the Apostate Caverns (requiring \nan Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test). Unless they can come \nup with further options, the group faces the unpleasant task \nof locating and dealing with any other infected victims before \nit is too late.\nHopefully Rylus survived intact and can carry out whatever \ncourse of action the Battle-Brothers convinced him to follow \nwith regard to the Imperium. If he did not, then Alkedre \ninherits the title of Caele and immediately begins to use this \nincident as a rallying point for the Aurans’ need to unite with \nthe Imperium. Although deeply saddened by the turn of events, \nboth Rylus and Alkedre support the Kill-team in whatever \nmust be done to cleanse the recently infected. At some point \nduring the follow-up, Heth, (assuming he survived) comments \nthat all this might have been avoided if the Aurans had trusted \nthe Imperium to help with their problem from the beginning.\nIt is up to the GM to determine the success of the Kill-\nteam’s approach to cleansing this last Genestealer taint—both \nin truth as well as in appearance. If Karthas has survived \nundetected until now, he does his best to avoid any tests \nor scans that might reveal him now. Of course, if he is not \nstealthy enough that might finally be his undoing.\nOnce the Deathwatch has closed matters to their \nsatisfaction, Lan returns with them to the Horizon’s Pride. \nTheir choices will have long-lasting ramifications for the fate \nof the golden planet.\nA SOLEMN RETURN\nLan sincerely thanks the Battle-Brothers on behalf of the \nCrusade for their help with Aurum, but otherwise keeps to \nhimself, sobered by his brush with the Genestealers. When the \nship reaches Erioch, he bids them a formal but brief goodbye \nbefore leaving them to debrief with their Watch Captain.\n44\n\nI\n:\n The Price of Hubris\nrewardS\nTable 1–2 Mission Experience Rewards shows the value \nof completing each of the Objectives if you award experience \nusing the detailed mission-based method. Additionally, if the \nBattle-Brothers recovered the thaumagramm diode schematic, \nthis is worth 100 additional XP, as is vindicating Kohl Bennex, \nand discovering the promethium operation. If the Kill-team \nexposed Karthas as a servant of the enemy, award 150 XP. If \nthey realised that the brood was targeting Lan, award 50 XP, \nor 100 XP if they realised and prevented it from occurring. \nThe following are worth 2 Renown each:\n•Completing the Divested Hunt\n•Convincing the Aurans to join the Imperium; if the \nKill-team incited war with the Aurans, this subtracts 2 \nRenown from the total earned on the Mission\nThe following are worth 1 Renown each:\n•Purging (or appearing to purge) the Genestealer threat \nfrom Aurum\n•Keeping all of the Imperial NPCs (Heth, Father Marius, \nand Lan) from dying\nAs always, the GM should feel free to further reward clever \nplans and good roleplaying.\nfuture iMpliCationS\nThe most immediate ramification of this Mission is the \ndisposition of Aurum. Depending on how the Battle-Brothers \nleft the planet, the Imperium may have gained a valuable \nworld, whose conscripted troops soon appear in Imperial \nGuard regiments. Or they may have created one more bloody \nbattlefront that the Battle-Brothers one day need to return to. \nIf Karthas and his infected allies were not uncovered, then \nthe Genestealer infestation will almost certainly undergo a \nresurgence on the golden planet. If they were destroyed, then \nperhaps that threat truly has been ended—or perhaps not if it \nsuits the GM. The nature of the unusually nurturing planet’s \n“spirit” remains unaccounted for as well.\nRelevance to Dahzak’s Plan\nThe Space Marines hopefully found the bodies of the apostate \nAdeptus Mechanicus, whose use for the Decavane crystals at \nthis point remains unclear. They may also have recovered \nthe schematics for the thaumagramm diode, which can be \nslowly deciphered by PCs or NPCs in the time leading up \nto The Sword of Vigilance. Several of the Kill-team’s choices \necho through the overall story of the emperor protects.

Beneath \nthe shadow that eclipsed an age, they slumber. Beneath the tenuous \ngrasp that reaches to reclaim, they slumber. Do not wake the sleeping \nancients.\n–anonymous prophecies found in   \nWatch Fortress Erioch’s Vaults\nK\narlack is the lynchpin of the Achilus Crusade’s \nmilitary might and central to the defences of the Iron \nCollar which guards the Well of Night. The natives \nof the once-green planet maintained their Imperial traditions \nthrough the Age of Shadow, and welcomed the Crusade as \nlong-lost allies. Their reward was a planet quickly leeched of \nresources and transformed day by day into a teeming hive of \nsoldiers and bureaucrats working to keep the Crusade moving \nforwards. The dwindling local population have forgotten why \nthey ever welcomed the Imperium, and their complacency \nhas turned to a festering resentment as they choke on their \npoisoned air and are forced to scrounge for the very crops \nthey have been forcibly recruited to grow.\nYet something older than mankind and its petty feuds \nsleeps beneath the surface of Karlack. In an age long before \nman began to count the years, it became the resting place \nof an ancient alien race with technology far beyond human \nunderstanding. Some senior members of the Ordo Xenos \nhave tracked the remnants of this civilisation not just to the \nJericho Reach, but to lost worlds and ancient ruins across \nthe galaxy. They see the signs of a race whose reach was \nseemingly unlimited. What only a few of these scholars \nsuspect is that the tombs hold not corpses, but an \ndiabolical force that waits to one day rise again.\nThese ancient xenos possessed many secrets \nof mastery over space and time that Dahzak must \nrediscover in order to perfect his thaumagramm \ndiodes. The sorcerer and Magos Vayze seek a piece of \ntechnology called a vector amplifier. However, retrieving \none from the tombs on Karlack required infiltrating the most \nhighly protected Imperial planet in the Jericho Reach. To \ncarry out such a daunting mission, the Vinculum Proselytes \nturned to the Alpha Legion—Chaos Space Marines who \nexcel in such strikes behind enemy lines. For years the Alpha \nLegion on Karlack has sabotaged Imperial forces and incited \nnative rebellions to misdirect and weaken Imperial resistance \nwhile they search for their objective. During those same years, \nInquisitor Zaer Vincent of the Ordo Xenos also delved into \nthe mysteries of Karlack. This brought him into competition \nwith the Alpha Legion, and they kidnapped him to learn \nwhat he knew and to keep him off their trail. However, \nwhen an Inquisitor disappears, eventually someone is going \nto notice. And that someone is about to recruit the aid of   \nthe Deathwatch.\nOVERVIEw\nThe Alpha Legion’s influence has slowly permeated Karlack \nlike the tendrils of an insidious infection. Even before Alpha \nLegion cell leader Lamdus Rize allied with Dahzak and the \nVinculum Proselytes, the planet’s xenos legacy was of interest \nto him as a tool in his efforts to raise anti-Imperial sentiment \namong the population. His most successful anti-Imperial \ncult feeds on the fallacy of a benign master race that once \ninhabited Karlack. This group calls itself the Reborn; Yale \nIvaris—handpicked by Rize to grow the group’s size and \ncapabilities—leads the xeno-cult in rebellion and recruitment. \nAlthough the evidence of a past civilisation cannot be denied, \nthe rest of this xeno-cult’s creed is entirely contrived by the \nAlpha Legion to create unwitting servants.\nSince committing to aiding Dahzak’s assault on the \nwarp gate, Rize has turned the xeno-cult’s attentions \ntowards unearthing their deities’ legacy. Inquisitor Vincent’s \ninvestigations into the same subject made him a danger \nand an opportunity. After capturing him, the Alpha Legion \nmasqueraded as Black Templars to infiltrate his quarters in \nan Imperial fortress, plundered his research, and left a deadly \ntrap for whoever might try to investigate his disappearance. \nAlthough he managed to kill several of the Chaos Space \nMarines, Vincent ultimately failed to stop the Alpha Legion \nfrom extracting his secrets. \n52\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nIt is Vincent’s disappearance that draws the Battle-Brothers \ninto Karlack’s turmoil. Inquisitor Quist requests their aid in \nlocating her colleague. However, the Alpha Legion’s trap \nsoon leaves the Battle-Brothers on their own to investigate \nnot only Vincent’s disappearance, but also the attempt on \nQuist’s life and the false Black Templars. Their trail leads to \nthe Cenotaph of Achilus in Kar’thir. Here, the Battle-Brothers \nhave their first encounter with the Reborn. They also have \nthe opportunity to meet one of Vincent’s surviving cadre. In \nKar’thir all evidence points towards a looming threat in the \nxenos ruins beneath Karlack’s ocean. In the rebellious and \ngeologically unstable southern islands, the Battle-Brothers \nmust gather enough information to locate this sunken city. \nThe archipelagos also hold the chance to run up against \nIlvaris and his minions, the Vinculum Proselytes, and discover \nthe fate of Inquisitor Vincent.\nOnce they have acquired the necessary information and \nresources, the Kill-team can enter the cursed alien necropolis. \nWhen they arrive, they find that the Chaos Space Marines \nhave already started a chain of events that could lead to the \nrise of an alien war host in the very heart of the Crusade’s \nfortress world. They must find a way to reverse their enemies’ \nwork or see Karlack submerged under a tide of xenos.\nUNSTABLE FOUNDATIONS\nKarlack is a planet in the midst of a radical transformation. \nThe Imperium would say it is reaping the benefits of \ninclusion in the glorious Imperium of Mankind, but not \nall the indigenous people share such rosy optimism. If the \nKill-team had a hand in changing Aurum’s permanent status \nwith the Crusade during The Price of Hubris, Karlack serves \nas a portal to a future that will be or might have been for \nthe Aurans. Karlack’s setting should evoke a strong contrast \nbetween the Imperial military might and the feudal traditions \nbeing eroded. Literally and thematically, A Stony Sleep is \nabout power built on shaky foundations. Rebellion festers in \nthe Crusade’s greatest stronghold, xenos tombs lie beneath \nKarlack’s holy places, and traitors litter the ranks of the just \nand the unjust alike.\nMISSION MODIFIcATIONS\nIn addition to the usual scaling of enemy numbers that you \nneed to do for group size and experience level, this adventure \ncontains challenges designed for the squad to overcome by \nworking together. If your group is particularly small, you \nshould decrease the number of challenges at the Kal’thane \nBulwark, and decrease the difficulty of destroying the \npower matrix in the sunken city. If you want to run A Stony \nSleep as a standalone adventure, the Alpha Legion certainly \nhas enough incentive to see Karlack fall even without the \nVinculum Proselytes’ influence. \ndowntiMe\nEvery Mission in the emperor protectsincludes a return \nto Watch Fortress Erioch and the opportunity for Battle-\nBrothers to interact with each other and the NPCs there. \nSome GMs may prefer to abbreviate these segments and \nget to the action faster. However, a Battle-Brother’s life and \nrelationships between Missions can be very different from his \npersonality on the field of duty. GMs running long campaigns \nthat focus on character development and politics should make \nsure the players have these chances to showcase a different \nside of their characters. By their nature Missions also tend to \nbe isolated. Erioch is the most convenient (though certainly \nnot the only) centre for interactions that span a campaign \nrather than a single adventure.\naquatiC CoMBat\nA large portion of this Mission takes place in an oceanic \nregion. While no encounters were explicitly written to take \nplace in the water, any number of circumstances might cause \nthe GM to need rules for combat in this environment. For \nunderwater combat, Weapon Skill and Ballistics Skill Tests \nare at –20 while submerged. A Swim Test is required to move \neffectively during aquatic combat. If the Test is passed by \ntwo more degrees, the difficulty of Attack Tests are reduced \nby –10. For further information, Chapter VII: Playing the \nGame in the DeathwatchRulebook provides extensive \ninformation about swimming and water terrain.\ninquiSitor adrielle quiSt\nAdrielle Quist was first noted by Inquisitor Carmillus \nfor her prodigious telepathic abilities and sharp, \ninvestigative mind. She was one of a select few Acolytes \nbrought to the Tower of Brass when her mistress became \nInquisitor of the Chamber at Erioch. Quist earned her \nrosette five years ago, and remains Carmillus’s primary \nfield agent. She has a deep fascination with alien \ntechnology that she keeps tightly concealed. She is all \ntoo aware that many around her would brand her a \nradical or traitor for her desire to see the Imperium \nstudy and match the technological advancement of \nraces like the Tau. She is secretly one of the Crucible \nResolviate’s principal sources of xenos artefacts.\n53\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nA Missing \nInquisitor\nI\nf any of the Kill-team know Inquisitor Quist well enough \nto care about her movements, then they are aware that \nshe has been back upon Erioch only a few days before \nrequesting a meeting in her chambers at the base of the Tower \nof Brass in the early hours before the waking cycle. True to its \nnamesake, this spire knifes into the void from the hull of the \nWatch Fortress. Quist is afforded several linked rooms in the \nlower levels. Read aloud or paraphrase the following when \nthe Kill-team arrives:\nThe vaulted doors into the Tower of Brass have remained \nunchanged over the millennia, inscribed with the catechism of \nhate: The Mark of the Xenos. However, the guard stationed \noutside them changes as the title Inquisitor of the Chamber \nchanges bearers. The size and nature of an Inquisitor’s sentry \nforce is indicative of the resident of the gleaming edifice. In \nkeeping with Inquisitor Hezika Carmillus’s violent and martial \nnature, she keeps no guard at all: a message that she can face any \nthreat on her own.\nYou pass through the unlocked doors and ascend two \nspiralling flights of stairs to Inquisitor Quist’s audience room. \nOne wall is a transparent plate of glassteel facing into the void. \nAt this time before Erioch’s weak dawn, it faces the dim light \nfrom the system’s cold, rising star. Quist stands in the centre of the \npatterned marble floor, arms clasped behind her back.\nThe Inquisitor exchanges brief, cursory greetings with \nthe Kill-team before continuing. Her request stems from a \nmissive only hours old, and she is eager to act upon the news \nit contained. Quist deals well with Space Marines in part \nbecause she has never been one for idle pleasantries, and this \nmeeting holds even less of them than usual.\nAs soon as you have all entered the room, she speaks. “I will be \nbrief, as time is of the essence. Too much has already been wasted \nby the careless and the idle. I do not believe any of you ever made \nthe acquaintance of my colleague, Inquisitor Zaer Vincent. He \nwas—is—a fine man with a nose for secrets. It may have finally \nbeen his end. He has been investigating an increasing number of \nharmful incidents and rumours of a xenos presence in Karlack’s \nless tamed southern hemisphere. I’m sure I do not need to elaborate \non the ramifications if such rumours should prove true on the \nCrusade’s key fortress world. Yet no one has heard from Vincent \nin many months.” She holds up a folded letter. “Until now.”\nQuist goes on to tell the Kill-team that she received \nthe letter, written in Vincent’s hand, only hours ago. It is \ndated 816.M41. The perils and inefficiencies of war on an \nunclaimed frontier kept it from her hands for almost a year. \nNow, long after his disappearance his last communication has \nfinally reached the Ordo Xenos. Quist has a close personal \nhistory with Vincent, and his hand-written letter was sent \nbecause of that history more than any official reason. She \ndoes not elaborate on their background; she simply presents \nthe Kill-team with the letter (see page 55). \nWhen they are done reading it, she says:\n“Whatever malign forces protect these secrets, they may have \nalready killed one of my Ordo. I do not intend to be their next \nvictim. Will you aid me in exposing and purging any xenos taint \non Karlack?”\nQuist knows little more of Vincent’s investigation than \nis written in the letter. To her knowledge, he has been out \nof contact since departing with a handful of Throne Agents \nto Karlack. If anyone comments on the personal tone of the \nletter, or asks what he was apologizing for, Quist dismissively \ninsists that it has no bearing on the Mission.\nARMING AND OATH-\nTAKING\nT\nhis Mission has a suggested Requisition rating of 140 \n(rounded down from 143) based on the following \nassumptions:\nPrimary Objective: Protect Inquisitor Quist from harm \n(Skilled Objective, 17 Requisition)\nPrimary Objective: Complete Inquisitor Vincent’s \ninvestigations into the southern oceans (Skilled Objective, 17 \nRequisition)\nPrimary Objective: Prevent the sleeping ancients in \nthe city beneath the sea from rising (Veteran Objective, 18 \nRequisition)\nSecondary Objective: Discover the fate of Inquisitor \nVincent (Novice Objective, 11 Requisition)\nSecondary Objective: Kill or capture Isiaah Faln (Veteran \nObjective, 13 Requisition)\nSecondary Objective: Get past the Alpha Legion forces \nin the tomb city (Veteran Objective, 13 Requisition)\nSecondary Objective: Determine the city’s exact location \n(Skilled Objective, 12 Requisition) \nSecondary Objective: Find a way to enter the tomb city \n(Novice Objective, 11 Requisition)\nSecondary Objective: Acquire transport capable of \noperating in extreme ocean depths (Skilled Objective, 12 \nRequisition)\nTertiary Objective: Prevent the Sons of Taeg from \ncompleting their assassination at Citadel Primaris (Veteran \nObjective, 8 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Help Mediator Dyne deal with Alexei \nDrahj (Skilled Objective, 7 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Defeat the xeno-cult beneath the \nCenotaph (Novice Objective, 6 Requisition)\n54\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nThis seems like a high rating for an escort Mission, since \nthe Deathwatch has no idea what they are actually sending \nthe Battle-Brothers into. However, one Inquisitor has already \nvanished, and Quist has a vested personal stake in the Kill-\nteam’s success. Since she is the Mission Authority, it is easy to \njustify why she might be generous with equipment.\nTHE INqUISITOR’S SHIP\nAs the chief field agent of Erioch’s Inquisitor of the Chamber, \nInquisitor Quist spends far more time in the void than she \ndoes on Erioch. Her ship, the Angelus Invictus, is modest in size \nbut highly customised. She provides the Battle-Brothers a \ncommunal but sizable room for the journey. Retractable metal \nslabs are built into the walls; their size is identical to the stone \nplinths of Erioch’s cells, leaving little doubt that this room \nwas made for the explicit purpose of transporting Kill-teams.\nThe ship has only a skeleton crew; whatever cadre \nthe Inquisitor has, they are obviously out upon their own \nmissions. Other than a few servitors and a decrepit cherub \nthat rarely shifts from its perch in the galley, the living crew is \nlimited to a pilot, a Navigator, and a Vindicare assassin.\nSaMinel Modar\nQuist’s Navigator lurks inside a voluminous cloak. Its shroud \nprotects him from sight, providing only fleeting glimpses of \nshadowed and weathered skin beneath. He does not avoid the \nKill-team, but never engages them in conversation, speaking \nonly when spoken to. His raw voice responds with flawless \nhigh gothic, in a tone as cold and timeless as the void itself.\nnihl zee\nThe Vindicare Temple is a sanctioned sect of the Officio \nAssassinorum. Their agents specialise in stealth and sniping. \nNihl left Hive Malfi for the training temples on Terra at so \nyoung an age that he remembers nothing else. He is a lithe, \nquiet man who speaks to everyone—serf, Space Marine, and \nInquisitor—with eloquent but brief honesty. He does not \nseem particularly pleased to have been tithed to the Ordo \nXenos, but speaks no ill of the Inquisitor or her cadre. \nthe aBSent pilot\nThe door to the bridge remains locked for the duration of \nthe trip, and the crew avoids discussion of the pilot. If the \nBattle-Brothers make any attempt to approach the bridge, \nQuist meets them with a polite request to respect the privacy \nof her agents.\n55\nTo: Inquisitor Adrielle Quist\nFrom: Inquisitor Zaer Vincent\nSubject: The City in the Sea\nPriority Clearance: Arch-Emblematis\nAdrielle,\nI know that our last conversation was less than civil, but as I prayed for guidance on who could fulfil my \ntask if I failed, no face came to my mind but yours. I am perilously close to finally uncovering the truth \nbeneath the legends and fatalities associated with Karlack’s southern seas.\nMy latest work with the island sensor arrays has showed conclusively that a group of unnatural \nstructures does lie beneath the ocean, and I have triangulated them with nearly with enough precision \nto make the journey. However, I have begun to suspect that I am not the only one interested in \nfinding these ruins. The surrounding islands teem with xeno-cultists. Their most troubling aspects are \nthe unusual degree of organisation they have displayed lately, and the core of well-researched theories \nabout the planet’s xenos history that underpin many of the tenets of their religion. It seems unlikely the \nnatives could have made such deductions on their own. Either an outside force is aiding these rebels \nand cultists, or Karlack’s ancient inhabitants are not as dead as we foolishly believed.\nI have one last preparation to make, and then I will be departing for those cursed waters. I pray to the \nThrone that I will only find the dead. As you know too well, caution has always been my blessing and \nmy curse. If some ill should befall me, my notes are in my quarters at Citadel Primaris. And if this is my \nlast opportunity to tell you, I’m sorry.\nThe Emperor Protects,\n–Zaer\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nThe Fortress \nWorld\n“Let this moment mark the turning of the ages. We return the \nEmperor’s light to this planet as we return it to this shadowed \nReach. This fortress will stand as a monument to the Imperium’s \nimmortality.”\n–Lord Militant Achilus at the groundbreaking of Karlack’s \nCitadel Primaris\nT\nhe approach to Karlack is unique within the Jericho \nReach. Read aloud or paraphrase the following on \napproach:\nAt the heart of the Crusade’s military power and the centre of the \nIron Collar that defends Imperial possession of the warp gate, \nthe fortress world’s perimeter is littered with defences. The first \nlayer of fortified space is a sphere of mechanised battle stations, \ntheir augur arrays constantly scanning the void. A few track the \nAngelus Invictus with their plasma batteries as it passes. Next, \non the outskirts of the occupied ring, are the massive space \ndocks where Adeptus Mechanicus adepts repair and slowly \nconstruct new ships for the Imperial Navy. These jagged spires \nand gargantuan platforms berth everything from gleaming new \nfighters to the war-ravaged skeletons of cruisers who survived \nbattles their crews did not.\nSupply stations, more advanced sensorium arrays, and void-\nfaring troop barracks orbit closer to the faded greyish-green planet. \nKarlack’s sky and atmosphere are thick with the smoke of industry \nand clouds of dirt thrown up by the ongoing construction. Once \nyou clear the brackish cloud layer, the landmasses are patchworks \nof bare earth, dull armoured fortifications, and the occasional \nstretch of green farmland where fast-growing crop strains are \ncontinually planted and harvested for processing into rations.\nTens of thousands of troops and transports stage from \nKarlack at any one time, regiment upon regiment preparing \nto replace the losses of an especially bloody battle in one \nof the Crusade salients. However, in addition to the many \nbases and emplacements in its orbit, the planet also requires a \nlarge permanent garrison for defence and maintaining order. \nSuch troops occupy hundreds stations across Karlack, but the \nlargest, first, and most important of these is Citadel Primaris.\nCitadel Primaris towers like a mountain above a plain of \nlevelled earth. Observation decks and weapon emplacements \njut from the sloping walls at regular intervals. The Angelus \nInvictus lands on one of the immense duracrete pads between \na Valkyrie transport and a huge Marauder bomber. Inquisitor \nQuist presents her rosette to the straight-backed guards at the \nmain gate, and the Kill-team proceeds inside. A large gravel \nyard lies beyond the high walls, where several squads are \ndrilling under the watchful eye of a Commissar. Before Quist \nand the Battle-Brothers can even cross the yard, a man in a \nGeneral’s dress uniform emerges from one of the tall bastions, \nflanked by a dozen guards in black flak armour. \nThe man is Lord General Castus Iacton. He briskly but \ncourteously greets the team before ushering them into his \nready room. Recognition sparks in the Lord General’s eyes as \nQuist explains who she is and why she has come. When she \nfinishes, Iacton replies:\n“Inquisitor Quist, I was beginning to wonder if you were ever \ngoing to come. Your colleague left this behind, with the strictest \norders that I was to deliver it to you only.” He walks to a small \nadamantine vault edged with gold filigree, and aligns several \ndials. The door swings open, and he withdraws a lacquered \nbox. It is etched with ornate designs, and held shut by a series of \nwarded locks even more diabolical than the one on his safe. He \ncarefully presents the box to Inquisitor Quist.\nAs Quist takes the box from his gloved hands, have the \nBattle-Brothers make Challenging (+0) Awareness Tests. \nAnyone who passes notes a faint astringent odour as she \nworks the locks. It may occur to them that Quist is the only \nindividual in the room not wearing gloves. Immediately after \nreporting this fact to any characters that succeeded in the \ncheck, read aloud or paraphrase the following:\n56\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nThe Inquisitor spends a moment scrutinizing the interlocking \nchains and coded wards. Then, she slides a chain aside to reveal \na circle of runes with the Inquisition’s symbol in the centre. She \ndepresses the symbol and the runes light up in an amber glow.\nPause briefly after this section, giving the players a chance \nto interject if they desire. If no one interrupts, continue:\nBuried within the chain links and carved into the locks are \npartial icons, like pieces of a puzzle. In a very deliberate order, \nInquisitor Quist rotates the fastenings to align the symbols. As she \nforms each one: a skull, a leering face, a sword, the amber runes \nturn green. At last only one remains. She pauses for a few seconds, \nsquinting at the box as though to clear her vision.\nAgain, pause here to give the players a chance to interrupt. \nIf they still do nothing, continue:\nShe rubs her temples and aligns the two halves of an Aquila. \nThe final rune turns green. As Quist lifts the lid her breathing is \nnoticeably erratic. She sways slightly. The box tumbles from her \nhands as she falls to the floor, colour quickly draining from her \nface. The unlocked box lies beside her, open lid showing nothing \ninside.\nThe box’s seal mechanism is laced with a virulent contact \ntoxin. The severity of Quist’s exposure to it depends on how \nlong she handled the box. If the Battle-Brothers interrupted \nbefore she started opening the box, she is incapacitated but not \nin danger of dying. If they separated her from the box before \nshe finished opening it, then she may make a Challenging \n(+0) Toughness Test to avoid the poison’s deadly effects. \nIf she opened the box, then no Toughness Test is possible. \nIf the toxin takes effect, the Inquisitor’s life is forfeit without \nimmediate medical attention.\nIn addition to the missing Inquisitor Vincent, the Kill-team \nnow has a (hopefully) near-assassination to contend with. If \nQuist lives, she is at best severely weakened and must remain \nunder the care of the Citadel’s medicae staff. Nihl Zee remains \nat her side to stand guard. She charges the Kill-team with \nfinishing her Mission, and discovering who made the attack. \nAt this point the Citadel is open to them. \nlord general CaStuS iaCton\nLord General Iacton has the heavy responsibility of \ncommand over Karlack. He is the most senior military \nofficer on the planet, and bears responsibility for \nkeeping it safe from both outside attack and any \ninternal failing of faith, security, or logistics. This \nduty does not encompass just the ravaged planet, but \nextends to the farthest hollowed-out asteroid and \nsmallest monitor buoy in the system. He is a stern \nman tasked with more responsibilities than one man \ncould ever hope to handle. The ceaseless demands of \nhis duties have left him short on patience—even for \nInquisitors and Space Marines.\nthe fate of inquiSitor quiSt\nA swiftly administered Ordinary (+0) Medicae \nTest can save the Inquisitor’s life. If the group lacks an \nApothecary, the GM should be generous in allowing the \nKill-team to salvage this objective in some other way—\nperhaps through a clever application of the anti-toxins \nstored in their power armour. It is also possible that a \nMedicae in the Citadel could be summoned quickly \nenough to prevent her death. If the Kill-team makes \nlittle effort to save her and the GM has no further use \nfor Quist in his campaign, there is nothing to stop her \nfrom expiring before the Battle-Brothers’ eyes either. \nHowever, this should be an appropriately grave moment \nfor the Battle-Brothers, as it was their task to protect the \nInquisitor on this Mission—a task they have now failed. \nThey will surely want to seek out and bring justice to \nthe enemy that so dishonoured them.\nditChing the inquiSition\nIf Quist never gets near the box (or wears her gloves \nthat day), the GM should consider finding some other \nreason to separate her from the Kill-team. Her profile is \nprovided and she could continue to lead this Mission, \nbut this isn’t likely to be as engaging for the players. \nSolving xeno-cult conspiracies is the bread and butter \nof the Ordo Xenos, and if they remain with Quist, \nthe Space Marines could end up feeling like glorified \nbodyguards as she adeptly puts together the clues. \nSome other possibilities for putting the Battle-Brothers \nin control include:\n•Reveal the Alpha Legion’s involvement sooner—\nperhaps with a sighting of the Chaos Space \nMarines in their regular armour. The confirmed \nsighting of a Traitor Legion makes this a matter \nfor Space Marines at least as much as the Ordo \nXenos.\n•Increase the sense of urgency and have time pressure \nforce the group to split up. Quist and her agents \n(and possibly Dyne) retrieve the city’s coordinates \nfor the Kill-team. The storms and earthquakes \naround the planet increase, and Quist orders the \nKill-team to proceed immediately after acquiring \nthe submersible rather than waiting for her.\n•Increase the importance of Alexei Drahj. He gets \nwind of the Ordo Xenos and flees. Quist and Dyne \nmake pursuing him their priority, and the Kill-team \nmust complete the original Mission on Karlack.\n57\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nthe ready rooM\nLike everything Imperial on Karlack, the Lord-General’s \nready room carries the faint stigma of being “new.” Despite \nattempts to tarnish the gold luminators and age the parchment \nof freshly inked maps, one cannot help but notice the telltale \nlack of wear that comes with new construction. Several star \ncharts hang about the walls, with entirely too many un-\nclaimed worlds marked, and the Hadex Anomaly festering in \nthe very centre of the Imperium’s trident of conquest.\nIf questioned, the Lord General is cooperative though \nnoticeably impatient. He reveals the following information:\n•Inquisitor Vincent left Citadel Primaris almost a year \nago (around the date of his letter to Quist). When he \ndeparted, he left the box in his quarters.\n•The Inquisitor claimed to be here to staunch the \nflourishing Cold Trade of xenos relics in Kar’thir, but the \nLord General knew he spent a great deal of time on other \nmore secret matters.\nAfter a few minutes of questioning or at any point that \nthe conversation seems to be lagging or growing repetitive, \nIacton exclaims:\n“Isn’t there some report you can retrieve? I told all this to the \nother Space Marines just last week!” \nAccording to Iacton, the “other Space Marines” bore the \nmarkings of the Black Templars. (The Battle-Brothers may \nmake an Ordinary (+10) Common Lore (Jericho Reach) \nTest to realise that no Black Templars are on the roster of \nAchilus Crusade forces). The Black Templars asked Iacton \nmany questions about Inquisitor Vincent, and investigated the \nInquisitor’s quarters, which had been left undisturbed since \nhis departure. It was actually their suggestion that he move \nthe box from Vincent’s room to his vault. Once the other \nSpace Marines had finished their investigation, they departed; \nIacton believes they may have had a few documents in their \npossession. Their transport’s trajectory suggested they were \nheaded elsewhere on the planet, but beyond that Iacton has \nnothing to suggest.\ntroop BarraCkS\nCitadel Primaris can house whole regiments easily, but its \naccommodations are less than luxurious. As the fortress’s least \nvaluable resource, the guardsmen are stored in the exterior \nrooms, the first layer beyond the high protective walls. Tall \nladders line the walls so that occupants can climb to the upper \nbunks, which are stacked dozens high. The guardsmen peer \ndown curiously from their perches if they spot the Kill-team, \nbut keep their distance. They do not have any information on \nInquisitor Vincent; in fact the vast majority of them arrived \nafter his disappearance. However, they can offer various \nrelevant insights on the planet based on a Routine (+20) \nInquiry Test. (A Command Test may be substituted for this \nroll, but the Test becomes Challenging (+0) as the men are \nintimidated.) The GM may add appropriate bonuses for good \nroleplaying ( see Table 2–1 below).\nvinCent’S quarterS\nThe Inquisition’s reputation has been quite effective in keeping \nVincent’s room isolated. The troops who know it exists have \na very real fear of facing execution for glimpsing the wrong \ndocument or artefact. The room is a converted office, with \nan unmade and largely unused cot in one corner. The small, \ndisorderly room could easily be mistaken for the home of a \nlowly scribe. Parchment litters the desk and the cot, books lie \nopen—each with a dozen page markers in it, and stacks of \njournals tower perilously on every flat surface. Several of the \ndrawings depict geometric symbols of xenos origin. \nA Routine (+20) Search Test locates several items \nof interest. The first item is an Artefact Manifest (See the \nhandout on page 86) describing ruined fragments of the \nalien technology Vincent encountered on Karlack. It is stored \nwith the other materials of his investigation, suggesting some \nconnection between them. The Search Test also allows the \nSpace Marines to determine that a page has been freshly torn \nfrom one of his research journals. The journal’s title page reads \n“Beneath the Cenotaph.” The book is full of hand-written \nobservations, sketches, and theories about the ancient history \nof Kar’thir, where the Cenotaph of Achilus resides. Vincent’s \nnotes suggest that the indigenous city may have been built on \nthe ruins of a civilisation that pre-dated human settlement.\nTable 2–1: Information on the Southern Islands\nDegrees of SuccessResult\n0 \nThe southern continent is a source of strange occurrences, ill omens, and heretical cults. Troops are \nregularly deployed to put down uprisings and defend the scattered Imperial holdings.\n1\nAs above. Also, the cult activity in the south has been on the rise. In particular, a group called The Reborn \nhas been especially destructive.\n2\nAs above. Also, The Reborn used to be a fairly minor operation, no greater than the rest of the insurgent \nrabble. Their transformation into a serious threat began when a man calling himself Feynir Surbryte \nbecame their leader. Their operations are not isolated to the south, and they have hidden cells all across \nthe planet.\n3+\nAs above. Also, several people have been executed in Kar’thir over the last few years for participating \nin the underground sale of xenos artefacts, or the Cold Trade. Many suspect that a great deal of their \nproscribed stock comes from the south.\n58\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nIf the Search Test succeeds by two or more degrees of \nsuccess, the Battle-Brothers also find the torn scraps of a \nparchment strip behind a desk. This brief note was taken from \ninside the box by the impostor Space Marines, and shredded. \nHowever, a little patience can reconstruct the message. It \nreads:\nNo door that we would understand leads into the city. This key \nwill afford you entry.\nprinCe-prefeCt allewiS lxxxiii\nPrince Allewis the eighty-third ruled Karlack when the \nCrusade first made contact. The Imperium was quick to praise \nhim for his preservation of tradition and the Emperor’s creed. \nHe in turn was quick to support the re-assimilation into the \nImperium, and the re-introduction of the many wondrous \ntechnologies the people had forgotten. No one benefitted \nmore from these marvels than the Prince himself. The Crusade \nbestowed upon him the additional title of prefect, and has \nmade sure he lives in safety and comfort. He now occupies \na suite on one of the Citadel’s highest levels, sound-proofed \nagainst the clamour of armies and vehicles outside.\nAllewis is a shrewd politician who kept his planet in \nline with strong public demonstrations of force before the \nImperium’s arrival. His primary function now, beyond serving \nas a figurehead, is to advise the Lord General on his people’s \nculture. Although he has been able to take a far less active \nrole in the ruling of Karlack since the Crusade arrived, his \npolitical instincts remain unchanged. He understands that he \nstands in a precarious situation—dependent upon the Crusade \nto maintain his station, and yet in competition with them for \ninfluence over the planet and its resources. His best asset in \nthis power struggle is to grow his allies on and off planet. He \nis always quick to invite important visitors for an audience, \nand the Battle-Brothers are no exception. If they spend long \nat Citadel Primaris a native servant approaches them with a \nperfumed envelope bearing the wax seal of a sleeping felid.\nOptional Encounter: the Prince’s Sanctuary\nShould the Battle-Brothers take Prince-Prefect Allewis up on \nhis offer, they board an ascender that carries them hundreds \nof metres up to the Citadel’s upper levels. The Prince’s \nreceiving room is decorated with off-world luxuries and a \nlarge silver crest of a sleeping felid hangs prominently on the \nmantle. As the Kill-team arrives, read aloud or paraphrase the \nfollowing:\n“Welcome, welcome fine visitors.” The Prince-Prefect ushers you \ninto a richly appointed room that belongs in a noble’s hive spire, \nnot a fortress. The exterior balcony provides a sweeping view \nof the murky sky and bare earth outside. He gestures at a side \ntable obviously prepared by a shrewd diplomat versed in the \nAdeptus Astartes. A basin of ice holds large, sturdy goblets of \nwine sized so that even power-armoured hands can grip them. \nThe accompanying delicacy of Bekrin otter has been seared on \nlarge skewers making it equally easy to partake of. “Now, the \nAdeptus Astartes only call when something important is afoot. \nHow can Karlack’s Prince-Prefect assist you?”\n59\nThe CiTy BeneaTh The Sea\nThe legends associated with Karlack’s southern seas are so varied and mutable that attempting to sift out the \ngrains of truth from them has been a daunting task. Still, certain themes have recurred in my historical \nresearch and the hundreds of oral legends recounted to me. Points of agreement include:\nThe Sunken City—Dozens of accounts report the existence a vast ruined city deep beneath the southern ocean. \nDetails of its appearance are sparse, but the few that exist point with disturbing agreement to a definitively \ninhuman design.\nIll Omens—Virtually everything about the south is viewed with gloom and pessimism. Whether the tide is \nhigh or low, the sun shines or storms rage, soothsayers rush to call it bad tidings. Every disaster, poor crop, \nand stillbirth on the rest of the planet is quickly attributed to the omens from the south.\nRestless Machine Spirits—False augury readings, engine failings, rebellious weapons—all of these phenomena \nand more seem to occur with unusual frequency near the southern oceans. \nSpectres of Death—Of all the images conjured by the native tales, this is the one which haunts my dreams. \nThe most common purpose of these dark, ghostly apparitions is as collectors of lost souls. These black, shrouded \nbeings rise from the sea to drag men down to oblivion. Afterlives aside, what concerns me is that if any truth \nlies in this particular legend, then whatever lies beneath the sea may not be quite dead after all.\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nHe listens intently to whatever information they reveal, \nmaking noises of consternation and sympathy at all the \nappropriate moments. The Prince has two primary assets at \nhis disposal: the Planetary Defence Force and a vast network \nof eyes and ears across the planet. Once he has assembled an \nidea of what he might be able to offer the Battle-Brothers \nbased on his resources, he gets to his own agenda.\nThe relationship between Allewis and Lord General Iacton \nis strained at best. Allewis’s desire to maintain some security \nand standard of living on his planet (at least for himself ) is \nnot in accord with the Crusade’s great need for manpower, \nmaterials, and food. Their latest bone of contention is over \nthe re-building of the Karlack 1st. Iacton has his eyes on the \nroyal guard to provide a core of men with combat training to \nthis rebuilt regiment. Allewis on the other hand believes that \nthe Planetary Defence Force is already far understrength, and \ndoes not want to give away a single man.\n He asks them to speak to Iacton on his behalf, and persuade \nhim to leave the royal guard here. Allewis is confident that the \nopinions of the Adeptus Astartes would carry strong weight \nwith the Lord General. In exchange, he offers whatever aid he \nhas surmised might be helpful. This might include supplies, \nsightings of the Black Templars, or the simple promise of a \nfavour depending on what the Kill-team told him of their \nmission. If they refuse his offer, he is gracious, but provides \nno useful information aside from small talk of dreadful riots \nin the south. \nMustering ground\nVast flats of levelled ground radiate out for miles from Citadel \nPrimaris. A haphazard stream of troops lands and depart in \nshuttles at all hours of the day and night. The small figures of \nlone officers pace between the blocks of soldiers, bellowing \ncommands and catechisms that are swallowed in the perpetual \nroar of vehicles.\nThe Karlack 1st is slowly assembling in their allotment \nof dirt. This is no less than the fourth time this regiment \nhas been re-founded, and the Imperial Guard looks like it is \nrecruiting from the bottom of the barrel. The men still wear \ntheir woven native clothing; many are boys too young to \neven undergo Space Marine trials, while others are so old \nand sickly they seem unlikely to survive the space voyage \nto their first deployment. Their leader, Commander Emvire, \npaces restlessly through the scrawny ranks.\ntraining ground\nThe space between the outer Citadel walls and the main \nfortress itself is a training ground. Presently, several squads \nof the 16th Maccabian Janissaries run orderly drills on the \nhard-packed dirt. This regiment of iron-masked soldiers was \nrecruited from the Calixis Sector’s bright, cold shrine world \nof Maccabeus. Their grim determination and deep-rooted \nfaith make Maccabian troops well suited to the corrupting \nhorrors the Acheros Salient. \nMinka Thrace \nMinka Thrace leads the drills on the range. She is a small, \nfierce woman with a piercing grey gaze. She and her brother \nwere orphaned at a young age by a religious schism. She \nattended the Schola Pregenium and was tagged for a future \nof military leadership, while her brother joined the Black \nPriests.\noptional encounter: assault on \nthe prince\nPrince-Prefect Allewis has done a remarkable job keeping \nhimself in favour with most of the oppressed population. \nHowever, there are fractious elements that attribute \nconsiderable blame to him for the plight of Karlack’s native \npeople. One such group calls themselves the Sons of Taeg, \nafter the dead baron of Kar’thir. The enmity of this small but \ncapable minority is one of the things that keeps him behind \nthe fortress walls. Hatred is a powerful motivator, and even the \nfortress is not enough to deter the Sons of Taeg. Composed \nlargely of former knights and other members of what used to \nbe Karlack’s privileged class, these men were already trained \nin the primitive arts of war. They quickly added stealth and \nguile to their repertoire to avoid Imperial reprisals.\nFor months, they have carefully planned an assassination \nof “The Turncoat Prince.” One of their members enters the \nCitadel walls driving a six-wheeled transport stacked with \ncrates that allegedly contain rations. In fact it holds more \nSons of Taeg. Unfortunately for them, their timing coincides \nwith the Battle-Brothers’ presence. Shortly after the troops \nin the yard begin to file out from their drilling to return to \ntheir camps, the Sons of Taeg burst from their hiding place, \nwilling to sacrifice their lives to take down Prince Allewis. \nIf they are anywhere in the Citadel’s vicinity, the Kill-team \n60\nEsteemed Warriors of the God-Emperor,\nYou would do me great honour if you would meet with me at the summit of this magnificent Imperial castle. \nI know that men of your importance are always short on time. I promise you brevity, and an unparalleled \nknowledge of the places, people, and history of this humble planet. \nYour faithful servant,\nPrince-Prefect Allewis LXXXIII\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\ncannot miss the ensuing commotion. The Sons of Taeg profile \ncan be found on page 91 Most notably, each man has a \nsingle demolition charge containing 1d5+1 kg of explosives \nreadied. (Roll separately for the payload of each rebel, and \ndo not reveal the numbers to the players.) These bombs are \ndeadly, but they were intended to be planted, not thrown. If \na Son of Taeg becomes desperate enough to use his explosive \ncharge as a weapon, it travels only 2 metres + 2 metres for \nevery degree of success on his Ballistic Skill Test. If the Test \nis failed, this means it still detonates but travels nowhere. This \nmeans there is a high probability the thrower himself is caught \nin the blast. He will only make such an attack if death seems \nimminent (this includes being targeted by a Space Marine). To \nmake matters worse, the rebels stole fatigues from the green \nrecruits of the Karlack 1st, making them very difficult to pick \nout from actual Guardsmen. The bulk of their explosives is \nlargely what gives them away.\nThese explosives aren’t something that a Space Marine can \nignore, but fully armoured they can survive a few detonations \nand keep fighting. The real danger is not to the Battle-Brothers, \nbut to Citadel Primaris, its stationed troops, and of course to \nPrince-Prefect Allewis. By the time the Battle-Brothers reach \nthe training range, it is a confused maelstrom of combatants, \ncorpses, and explosions. Assume at this juncture the surviving \nnumber of Sons of Taeg number twice that of the Kill-team. \nThe following rules apply to this fight:\nCamouflaged Enemy: On the first Round a Space Marine \nenters this combat, and every time he wishes to locate a new \nhostile target, he must make an Awareness Test to pick out a \nSon of Taeg from the actual Guardsmen. (No Test is required to \nlocate a foe one of his Battle-Brothers is already fighting.) \nStand Back!: An exploding demolition charge kills a \nnumber of Guardsmen equal to the blast radius of his charges \n(kg x 3) unless the Battle-Brother takes some action to get them \nout of the way before his opponent dies. His options are:\n•The Battle-Brother can order the Guardsmen to get clear \nof the combat. To do so, he makes a Routine (+10) \nCommand Test. If he succeeds, the soldiers pull back \na number of metres equal to their Full Move (6) plus 1 \nmetre for every Degree of Success. This is a Half Action \nfor the Battle-Brother and may be repeated to move the \nmen further.\n•The Battle-Brother can toss men great distances with his \nenhanced strength (although the “saved” Guardsmen may \nend up with bruises and broken bones). For every Half \nAction he spends sweeping Guardsmen out of the way, he \nremoves a number of men from the blast area equal to his \nStrength Bonus.\n•As a last resort, the Space Marine can throw himself on \na blast to shield others from the explosion. This requires \na Challenging (+0) Agility Test to act in time. If he \nsucceeds, the Battle-Brother fully stops the blast from \nkilling any Guardsmen, but the explosion adds an \nadditional 1d10 per 2 kg to its normal Damage. This is \na Reaction.\nDeath to the Turncoat!: The ultimate goal of the Sons of \nTaeg is to take out the Prince-Prefect. Any of the rebels who \ngo undetected for 5 Rounds make it inside the Citadel on their \n6th Round, and proceed towards the Prince-Prefect’s quarters. \nAssume the following progression of their movement:\n•Rounds 7-8: Moving through the halls towards the \nascender. Each agent has a 20% chance of being located \nand killed in combat with loyal forces before they make it \nto the ascender.\n•Rounds 9-12: Riding the ascender up to Allewis’s level\n• Round 13: Moving to Allewis’s quarters\n•Round 14: Attempting to blow up the Turncoat Prince. \n(All of Allewis’s guards are engaged in the fight outside \nthe Citadel.)\nfollowing the BlaCk teMplarS\nWhen the “other Space Marines” left the fortress, their next \ndestination was the Cenotaph of Achilus. In addition to \nVincent’s plundered notes, other possibilities exist for putting \nthe Kill-team on the trail to Kar’thir.\n•An enterprising Techmarine may filter through the data \nbanks from the Citadel’s sensor logs. A Challenging \n(+0) Logic Test can extrapolate their exact vector.\n•The Prince-Prefect may not personally step much outside \nthe Citadel these days, but his eyes and ears are another \nmatter. His informants in Kar’thir heard of black-clad \nSpace Marines in the city last week. Allewis expects a \nreciprocal favour for sharing this information, although \nhe may find himself disappointed.\n61\nthe ill-fated karlaCk 1St \nThe Crusade has raised five regiments from Karlack \nsince making contact with the planet, providing vital \nreplenishment to the forces from other sectors that ship \nthrough the warp gate. No tale of a regiment in the \nJericho Reach is a pleasant one, but the Karlack 1st \nhas been shattered and reformed three times since its \ninception.\n•786.M41: The regiment receives passage to \nthe coreward battlefront on the Lord Militant’s \nProclamation of Wrath. They are lost with Lord \nMilitant Achilus himself in the infamous Gellar \nfield failure.\n•812.M41: The regiment is decimated by the first \nTyranid offensive.\n•786.M41: The regiment is shattered on the Death \nWorld Ravacene, reduced to only a handful of men \nfrom the bloody war and toxic environment.\nCoMMander eMvire\nCommander Tarik Emvire has had the dubious fortune \nof surviving the last two events that desolated the \nKarlack 1st. He is a tall, burly man who now wields \na chain axe instead of the steel one he possessed as \nKar’thir’s master at arms before the arrival of the \nImperium. He has greyed significantly in the decades \nsince he joined the Hammer of the Emperor. He \nalso carries a persistent cough from the ash-choked \nenvironment of his last posting.\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\n•Mediator Dyne hears about the follow up on his master’s \ndisappearance and sends a message (intended for Quist) \nto the Citadel asking for a meeting in Kar’thir. Once in \nthe city, the Kill-team hears of the Black Templars’ recent \npresence. (See Stories from Kar’thir on page 63.)\nUPON THIS ROcK\nThe Cenotaph of Achilus looms in the heart of Kar’thir, \nKarlack’s largest city. This towering black monument entombs \nthe Crusade’s first Lord Militant, Tiber Achilus. Built upon \nthe ruins of an ancient Imperial temple, it has become the \nspiritual heart of the Crusade in many regards—with all \nthe curses and commendations that entails. Read aloud or \nparaphrase the following as the Battle-Brothers approach:\nThe Cenotaph is a gleaming monolith of black marble, built \nin the centre of a sprawling feudal town. It dwarfs the muddy \nwooden buildings that huddle like supplicants around its base. \nLarge swathes of bare earth scar the settlement and its adjacent \nlands; some of them hold the skeletons of abandoned construction. \nLarge cargo haulers rumble down other dirt paths, throwing huge \nclouds of dust into the air.\nThe Cenotaph was anticipated to become a popular \npilgrimage for the newly devout of the Jericho Reach. \nHowever, when the Crusade did not progress as smoothly as \nits leaders had hoped, they quickly abandoned their efforts \nto modernise Kar’thir in order to funnel resources into the \nsalients. The remains of their grand ambitions now crumble, \nneglected. A modest landing pad, one such fruit of these \nabandoned labours, sits on the edge of the city. An unpaved \ntrail leads from it up into Kar’thir’s heart.\nTHE cITY OF KAR’THIR\nBefore the Crusade’s arrival, Kar’thir was a prospering centre \nof art and commerce under the rule of Baron Taeg. Now, it has \nseen better days. The population has slowly atrophied from \nsickness and emigration. The Baron, the most visible member \nof Karlack’s nobility after the Prince moved to his new office \ninside Citadel Primaris, was executed for supporting rebellion \nseveral years ago—an Imperial verdict many natives question. \nWith its last advocate gone, the city is a desolate, grimy jumble \nof half-finished construction, abandoned feudal shops, and \nthe roaring machines of progress.\nA large majority of the settlement’s denizens are Karlack’s \nnatives, still eking out a living in the diminishing city. The \npeople of Kar’thir generally have one of two reactions to \nthe Battle-Brothers. Either they treat them with deferential \nrespect, or they avoid them with the same distance they give \nall representatives of the Imperium. These mixed reactions are \npartly caused by the citizens’ limited recognition of the Space \nMarines for what they are. The Adeptus Astartes are a subject \nonly depicted in oral tradition and extrapolated imagery. If \nthe Battle-Brothers make their nature clear to a native, they \nare more likely (though not guaranteed) to garner respect.\ntaeg Manor\nBaron Taeg’s ancestral home slowly crumbles in one quarter \nof Kar’thir. Respect and superstition keeps most of the locals \nfrom crossing through its iron gates. Its lawn is a stark patch \nof green in the dirty city, although it has evolved into a tangle \nof weeds and interlocking trees without anyone to maintain \nit. The three-story estate is dark within, and rumour says its \ndead Lord still walks the halls. The only ghost for the Battle-\nBrothers to encounter here is Mediator Dyne, a member of \nInquisitor Vincent’s cadre.\nDyne is extremely pleased to contact allies he can reveal \nhimself to. He offers his assistance on the Kill-team’s task \nunconditionally, and requests their aid with his duty. He has \nuncovered that the merchant Alexei Drahj is using Kar’thir as \na hub for smuggling xenos artefacts. He has the channels to \narrange a meeting by posing as a prospective buyer. However, \nwithout the rest of his cadre, he lacks the firepower to bring \nthe well-protected criminal to justice. Dyne asks if the Battle-\nBrothers are willing aide him in this matter. (See the Cold \nTrade optional encounter below.) \nforeigner’S triangle\nThe first Imperials to settle in Kar’thir occupied apartments \nbordered by three main thoroughfares. As more prospecting \ntraders and visiting Crusade officials gathered in this district, \nit took on its nickname with the natives. The first wave of \nimprovements to the city’s rudimentary infrastructure began \nhere. A few blocks of finished modern buildings stand alone \nin the epicentre of the abandoned renovation efforts. A \njagged ring of desolate skeletal structures and demolished lots \nradiates out from the triangle.\nThe Unfinished Basilica\nOn the outside, this incomplete Administratum building \nappears little different from the other lonely skeletons around \nit. The framework stops at six stories, with no more than \ncrossbeams laid on any floor. The eroding edifices still wait \nfor statuary and the arched windows remain open holes. \nThis unassuming exterior is precisely why the xenos artefact \ntraffickers of the Transpired Circle selected it for clandestine \nmeetings and exchanges. (See the Cold Trade optional \nencounter below).\nthe tannery\nFrom the outside, there is nothing noteworthy about this \nworkshop on the western edge of town except the usual \nstench of dead animals and tanning agents associated with \nleatherworking. However, its interior houses a passage that \nleads to an ancient site deep beneath the Cenotaph. It is \nobscured behind racks of hanging animal skins, and the \nBattle-Brothers are more likely to find themselves coming \nfrom the reverse side of the passage.\n62\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nthe oBSidian pavilion\nThe original centre of Kar’thir was razed (along with many \nbuildings) to accommodate the Cenotaph. Even though no \nsign remains of the dark stone tiles that gave the square its \nname, it maintains the title of “Obsidian Pavilion,” and still \nserves as the central function area of the city. The activity now \nclusters around the steps up to the towering monument.\nThe western side of the plaza holds freshly built stocks \nand a gallows. The stocks are crowded with transgressors \nagainst the Imperial Creed. The rest of the pavilion holds \na scattering of visitors and locals. The off-worlders are \nprimarily dignitaries and merchants making a show of piety. \nAlexei Drahj may be present with his usual retainers, casually \ninspecting the impoverished population’s wares. The desire \nfor new Imperial currency draws the natives to the foot of the \nCenotaph. They hawk everything from handmade jewellery \nto rough-carved aquila icons, largely by waving these wares \nin their hands. A sizeable portion of the peddlers offer stone \nfragments with dull gold etchings, calling them “Eternity \nCharms.” These trinkets are supposedly wrought from the \nruins of the holy site on which Kar’thir was founded, although \nsome smell suspiciously of fresh paint.\nStories from Kar’thir\nThe Obsidian Pavilion is the easiest place to interact with \nthe natives, although certainly not the only one. Below are \nvarious stories that might be gleaned through interaction   \nin Kar’thir:\n•“Everyone knows there’s something wrong with the \noceans below. There was an ill wind blowing from the \nsouth the day my wife bore our still babe. It was the cold \nbreath of the reapers that live on the ocean floor, coming \nto take our poor child.”\n•“Have you come to avenge Baron Taeg? His spirit rests \nill, I tell you. His shadow moves back and forth in the \nhalls of his old estate, and I’ve seen the lights flickering \nlate at night from the road outside.”\n•“Eternity Charms are nothing to be concerned with. \nThey’re just harmless little reminders that good works \ncan be immortal. Worse things change hands in Kar’thir. \nThe Transpired Circle come like vultures to pick the \nancient bones clean. The tales of what they find in the \nmud and rocks are so nightmarish I couldn’t begin to \ntell you what’s true and what’s not. But if you want \nsomething to look at, how about a nice, safe Charm? I’ll \ngive you a good price on this one.”\n•“What sort of miracle or menace has brought the holy \nAdeptus Astartes to us twice in so little time? I think I’d \nbest be strong in my ignorance—better not to know. But \nsure as I stand before you blessed warriors now, there was \nanother group here in the Pavilion just a few days ago. \nThey didn’t stop to bless us with their words as you have, \njust went right to the Cenotaph there.”\nthe Cenotaph of aChiluS\nThe Crusade’s first Lord Militant is memorialised in a tomb \nwhose grandeur is derived from brute size. There is nothing \nornate or intricate about the towering black monolith; it is just \na soaring pillar of stone engraved with an ever-growing tally \nof the lost. Before the Age of Shadow fell across the Jericho \nSector, Kar’thir’ centred around a fabulous church of the \nGod-Emperor built on the top of a rolling hill. That temple \nof Imperial faith toppled long ago, but the Cenotaph is built \nof magnificent black plinths excavated from its foundations.\nOn the western side of the monument there are tall \ndoors which lead into the crypt’s interior. These doors are \nsupposed to be sealed, and the fact that they stand damaged \nis an immediate sign that something amiss. A large breach \nexists in these panels, easily wide enough for a Space Marine \nMediator lazel dyne\nDyne is an accomplished sage, and often served as the \nface man for Vincent’s operations. He wears simple \nlocal robes with a draping hood to keep his cranial \nimplants from attracting attention. For two years he \nhas investigated the “Cold Trade” of xenos artefacts in \nKar’thir. Much of the last year has been spent waiting \nfor his master to return—a possibility that grows ever \nmore remote. \nIf Dyne hears that agents of the Ordo Xenos are \nnearby, he attempts to contact them. This may be via \nletter at the Citadel, or seeking them out in person if \nhe can find them in Kar’thir. Dyne can provide some \ninsight into the last known actions of Inquisitor Vincent. \nAccording to him, Vincent uncovered the location of \nthe ruins beneath the sea just before he disappeared. \nHe gathered his cadre to make some final preparations \nin the southern islands, and intended to then head \nfor the sunken city. Dyne is well-versed in the steps \nInquisitor Vincent had to carry out in his investigation \nof the city. He can educate the Kill-team on any or all \nof the obstacles they may face if they seek to find it \nthemselves. (See the Objectives on page 69.)\nDyne remained behind as he was close to rooting \nout the artefact traffickers. He never heard from the \ncadre again. He also knows that Vincent spent a great \ndeal of time in Kar’thir studying the Cenotaph, but can \nonly conjecture what connection it has to the xenos \nstructures in the southern ocean.\nin age there iS Strength\nIn the Imperium, older is usually better. Anything \nbuilt in contemporary times is a copy of a copy of a \ncopy of a design only half remembered. Karlack reeks \nof newness, and nowhere is that more apparent than \nthe Foreigner’s Triangle. Its architects did their best \nto weather the stone and tarnish the metal for a false \nveneer of age, but it does a poor job of concealing the \nplanet’s lack of mankind’s legacy.\n63\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nto enter. When the Battle-Brothers cross the threshold, the \ntomb’s interior is a drastically different environment from \nthe outside. The unexposed sides of the black marble retain \nstrange golden markings that glitter in the low light. A \ngiant white likeness of the lost Tiber Achilus stands in the \nmonument’s hollow heart, equally empty. The original Lord \nMilitant was lost to the warp, and the stone effigy serves the \nplace of a coffin. The path of the intruders is immediately \nobvious; a gaping hole in the floor leads down into the ruins \nbeneath the tomb.\nThe opening drops into the nave of a crumbling Imperial \ncathedral. The wooden pews have long since rotted, and \nany ornamentation been stripped by scavengers, but statue \nfragments and faded patches of murals remain. The Battle-\nBrothers find themselves facing fragments of their own \nlikenesses: Space Marines in old marks of armour carved into \nthe support pillars. However, the tunnels continue. The walls \nof multiple altar niches and the apse gape open, revealing \nthat an even more ancient site exists behind the Imperial \nconstruction. All of the chambers beyond are walled in the \nsame sleek black material that forms the Cenotaph itself.\nthe eMpty MauSoleuM\nBehind the apse is an empty, cavernous sepulchre. Bare shelves \nand empty platforms evidence the many sarcophagi that once \noccupied the chamber. A square platform stands in the middle \nof the chamber. All that remains of the dull metal statue once \ntopping it is a set of oblong boots with overlapping scales \nterracing the slope of the foot. Opposite the statue is a circle \netched in the black floor. Close inspection reveals inactive \ngold micro-circuitry inside its 5 metre radius. Everything else \nwas looted generations ago.\nthe CruMBling reliquary\nThis section of the ancient structure is in the worst state \nof disrepair. The construction above has caused collapsed \nwalls and earthen cave-ins that render this chamber a maze \nof rubble. A faint, repetitive scraping echoes from ahead. A \nChallenging (+0) Awareness Test identifies the sound of \nmetal tools in the dirt. It can also lead the listener to the source \nof the digging. Read aloud or paraphrase the following:\nAs you come around a crumbled pillar, you see three men in local \nclothes. They use shovels and spades to dig underneath the rubble. \nYou catch the last fragment of a conversation: “Don’t you think \nif they’ve spent all this time down here they must know the place \nbetter than us?” Another voice replies, “Didn’t say they don’t. Just \nsaying I don’t want to gamble they’re the types to share.”\nThe men’s names are Stephan, Weyr, and Kall. They freeze \nfor a moment at the sight of hulking men in power armour and \nthen react in uncoordinated panic. Roll Initiative and treat the \nensuing Rounds as a combat to determine if the grave robbers \nget a chance to act. They are not thinking rationally, and take \nthe following actions unless Very Hard (–30) Interaction \nTests are made. Stephan lobs his shovel in the Battle-Brothers’ \ndirection and tries to run deeper into the rubble to hide. Weyr \nbrandishes his pick and does his best to look menacing with \nit. He attacks with it if anyone draws near. Kall, the only one \nto apparently recognise them, drops to his knees and begins \npraying to the Emperor for forgiveness.\nWhen the “combat” is over, presumably the Battle-Brothers \nhave custody of at least one prisoner, along with their plunder. \nThe results of the men’s toil lie in a nearby burlap sack. It \ncontains a dozen chipped pieces of marble identical to the \n“Eternity Charms” and a strange green orb.\nObviously outclassed, the grave robbers are forthcoming \nwith any information the Battle-Brothers ask for. At this \njuncture they just hope not to be turned over to the local PDF \nofficers. They offer at least one of the Stories from Karthir (See \npage 63), and may also provide the following facts depending \non the conversation:\n•This is their third expedition since the opening appeared \nin the Cenotaph. Most of their findings have been Eternity \nCharms, but there was one other unusual item—a strange \nstaff with branching crescent blades—which they sold to \nAlexei Drahj.\n•They have heard strange voices coming from the other \nend of the ruins, past the carved tunnels. At first they \nthought it to be competitors for artefacts, but glimpses \nof hooded figures made them reconsider a confrontation. \nThey have stayed clear of that section. Its occupants must \nhave some other way in and out.\nThe men conclude any conversation with a vow never to \nenter the ruins again, and a plea to let them leave quietly.\nthe Carved tunnelS\nTwin tunnels wind back from two of the altars; their walls \ncovered in remarkably preserved images. While the familiar \nvertical strips of geometric golden script do occur at regular \nintervals, it is carved reliefs that dominate the passage. The \nimagery varies: landscapes with geometric structures, odd \nskeletal faces, and sarcophagi. A circular panel ringed with \nglyphs depicts a series of structures beneath a horizontal line. \nIf any of the Battle-Brothers stop to examine this image, the \nline could be interpreted as the level of the ocean above the \nbuildings. A Challenging (+0) Ciphers (Xenos Markings) \nor Hard (–20) Logic Test detects a recurring mathematical \ntheme in the symbols around the relief, suggesting map \ncoordinates. However, without the cipher key, no further \ndecryption is possible. \nthe CultiSt ChaMBer\nWhatever purpose the western ruins may have once served, \nthey are now a site of worship for the Reborn. The carved \ntunnels unite in a small vestibule which opens up to an \nimmense man-made chasm. This opening is 30 metres wide \nand appears to stretch down into the ground for hundreds, \nif not thousands of metres. Its present occupants are not the \nfirst to discover this location. Once a black facade covered \nthe entry chamber, but it is pitted and scarred from years of \nscavengers picking away at it. The walls on either side of \n64\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nthe deep chamber crumble a few grains at a time, weakened \nwhen the huge pillars used to construct the Cenotaph were \nexcavated. Deep below a warm light glows faintly, and soft \nvoices echo.\nThe descent towards the bottom of the chamber is \nthousands of metres. Without any additional gear the Climb \nTest is Challenging (+0)—a risky process, but not impossible. \nThe GM should provide generous bonuses for any clever \nideas on scaling down more safely, such as the Ultramarines’ \nLead by Example ability using knives for climbing spikes. For \nsimplicity’s sake use only one Test to represent the descent, \nwhich takes about thirty minutes. Should any character be \nin possession of suitable climbing gear or a Jump Pack, he \ncan make an attempt (with the most applicable Skill) to grab \nany comrade that fails his Climb Test and prevent them from \ntumbling to their doom. (If any unfortunate characters fail and \nare not saved, they wake up sore and bruised on a convenient \nrock outcropping many metres below, less one Fate Point.)\nAs the Battle-Brothers descend the wall, they can begin \nto observe the activity beneath them. If anyone is equipped \nwith magnification equipment, read aloud or paraphrase the \nfollowing:\nFigures gather below, dressed in the simple wools and cotton \nweaves of Kar’thir’s residents. Rising above them in the centre of \na room is a crude statue. Its metal body is humanoid but vaguely \ndefined—either deliberately or due to poor craftsmanship. Only \nthe head is clearly fashioned and painted; it depicts a stark white \nhuman skull.\nFurther down, their Auto-senses begin to pick out the \nwords spoken below them. Their leader (the tanner who owns \nthe shop with the passage in it) is sharing vibrant stories of \nthe generosity and benign deeds performed by beings called \nthe Undying. The Battle-Brothers catch the end of a parable:\nthoSe who CaMe Before\nThe Battle-Brothers are likely to guess that the recent \ndamage to the Cenotaph and the ruins below was \ncaused by the “other Space Marines,” and they would \nbe correct. The Alpha Legion impostors failed to obtain \nthe sunken city’s true location from Inquisitor Vincent, \nforcing them to retrace his steps in discovering it. All \nof the new openings (in the doors of the monument, \nthe ceiling and walls of the ruined cathedral, etc) \nhave a melted look and are ringed with the corrosive \nremains of a chemical reaction. Some form of potent \nacid burned these passages silently to avoid notice.\nthe reBorn\nIt is difficult to say how long this xeno-cult has existed \non Kar’thir, but they have waxed in size and power since \nthe Crusade’s arrival. This seductive philosophy begins \nby creating a level of comfort with the alien, awakening \nKarlack inhabitants to the reality that their world is built \non the ruins of an ancient civilisation. Then, the xeno-\ncult’s leaders extol the virtues they have surmised about \ntheir predecessors. They call this advanced xenos race the \nUndying. The Reborn hold that this wise and powerful \nrace first mastered technology, and then the mysteries of \nlife itself. They took to the stars to spread their knowledge \nand foster the growth of fledgling races. Eventually these \nbenefactors fell into peaceful slumber to let the young \nraces continue on their own. Some day they will awake \nand begin a new age of enlightenment and immortality \nfor the faithful.\nThe xeno-cult’s name refers to both the philosophical \nrebirth of extolling the alien over the human, and the \nimmortality they expect the Undying to bring when they \narise to reclaim the galaxy. The Reborn believe fervently \nin this utopian destiny, and violently defend it.\nthe alpha legion’S influenCe\nAll the Reborn truly believe in their creed, except their \nleader, Feynir Surbryte. The Reborn was little more than \na handful of dreamers and discontented rabble until the \nAlpha Legion took an interest in Karlack. They chose this \ngroup as the vehicle for their destabilisation, and inserted \na charismatic and devious new leader to help the Reborn \ngrow and organise. Now, they are a force to be reckoned \nwith. They have fanatical cells in nearly all of Karlack’s \nmajor population centres.\n65\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\n“And then the Undying said to the farmer: ‘I see that you have \nlearned well the lessons we have taught. Your crops flourish in the \ndrought while those of your neighbours wilt. I shall grant your \nrequest.’ The farmer fell to his knees in thanks as the Undying \nfloated gracefully to his ailing child. The Undying laid his cool \nhand upon the boy’s brow. The sickness left his body, and he was \nwhole again.”\n The xeno-cultists then spend several minutes offering their \npraise and devotion to the statue and talking excitedly of the \naliens’ return. When the team comes into visual range, everyone \ncan now see the scene described previously. The Battle-Brothers \ncan make Challenging (+0) Awareness Tests at 20 metres up \nto notice concealed ledges at that height (one on each side of \nthe room). Each of these large rock shelves has a large metallic \ndevice in its centre and a spiral passage leading down to the \nmain level. The passage take 25 metres of movement to traverse \nfrom ledge to floor. \nIf they continue down the chamber wall, have the Kill-\nteam make a Silent Move Test opposed by the Reborn Cultists’ \nAwareness when they are 15 metres from the floor. If they are \nnot detected, the xeno-cultists are Surprised on the first Round \nthe Space Marines reveal themselves. If they are detected, \nthen the Reborn initiate combat while the Space Marines are   \nstill climbing.\nEnough of the xeno-cultists recognise the Adeptus Astartes \nand know them as the enemies of their xenos idols that they \nrefuse to be drawn into conversation or negotiation. See the \nReborn Cultist profile on page 93. The main group forms \na Horde of Magnitude 32 around the statue. Two smaller \ngroups break off and flee into either side passage, emerging \na Round later on the concealed ledges. Each of these Hordes \nis Magnitude 20, and the two groups collectively control the \nlightning projector (as detailed in the sidebar). The elevated \nHordes gain the Fearless Talent as they have nowhere to go and \nare guarding sacred relics of the Undying, but the main group \nbreaks normally. \nThe passage back to the surface is clearly visible from ground \nlevel (and in fact is where the main Horde of cultists flees if \nbroken). Once the Kill-team has taken care of the Reborn, \nunless they want to make the long climb back up the chamber \nwalls, they are likely to take this exit back into Kar’thir. The \npassage slopes gently upwards. For a few hundred metres the \nwalls are smooth, as though cut with the same technology that \nbuilt the ruins. However, after that the walls become uneven, \nbraced by rotting wooden struts and frequently twisting around \nrock formations. It would have taken generations to tunnel this \nfar at Karlack’s current technology level. The Battle-Brothers \nfinally emerge in the tannery. Read aloud or paraphrase the \nfollowing:\nEven before you see the light of the exit, your Auto-senses alert \nyou to the stench of rotting flesh and excrement. You may wonder \nwhat sort of charnel house lies ahead. However, when you step \nout of the tunnel, the only dead you see are the skins of animals. \nYou are inside a tannery, where hides are splayed in the various \nstages of curing. A pair of young boys toil over the reeking vats.\nThe boys are the tanner’s apprentices, and if they spot the \nSpace Marines they stare in utter confusion and terror. The \nfrightened and bewildered boys can give the absent owner’s \nname (Oldreg) if asked, but appear to know nothing about his \nactivities outside the shop, or even the existence of the passage. \nThe bottom floor of the tannery is the workshop, and the upper \nfloors are divided into a room for the boys and one for their \nemployer. Oldreg’s room contains several handwritten stories \nsimilar to the one he told to the other xeno-cultists, and several \nEternity Charms. Each of the apprentices also has an Eternity \nCharm, given to them by their employer. As they cannot read, \nthey have no scriptures, but innocently confess that Oldreg has \ntold them many fables of the Undying. Although they were too \nyoung to join the cult, he had begun slowly poisoning their \nminds with his religion masked as children’s stories.\nthe Many-headed BeaSt\nIf the Battle-Brothers spend time examining Oldreg’s \npossessions, they come to the conclusion that the xeno-cult \nin Karlack is only one facet of a much larger whole. Oldreg \nhas a correspondence history with Feynir Surbryte. The \nletters appear to have been hand delivered, leaving no clues \nto Surbryte’s location. However, Oldreg appears to have been \nmaking notes on Inquisitor Vincent. The notes and letters \ndepict that Vincent visited the Cenotaph of Achilus repeatedly. \nFor the last several months before his disappearance, Oldreg \nor another xeno-cultist was constantly shadowing him.\nthe lightning projeCtor\nEach ledge holds a sleek silver array with three curving \nprongs. These devices are all that remain of the impressive \nweapons that once fortified this alien tomb. Over time \n(and many grisly deaths), the Reborn puzzled out how \nto operate the projectors. When activated, the two nodes \nform a crackling arc of electricity that can be directed by \npivoting the arrays.\nOnce per Round, in addition to their normal attacks, \nthe Reborn can make a Ballistic Skill Test as an attack \nagainst every Battle-Brother standing on the chamber \nfloor (but not on the walls or ledges). This attack may \nbe Dodged as normal. The lightning arc does 2d10+5 \nE Damage with AP 8 and has the Shocking Quality. \nThe projector only works so long as both nodes are \nactive. However, the mass of xeno-cultists prevents the \nBattle-Brothers from assaulting a node directly until the \nHorde around it has been reduced by at least 50% of   \nits Magnitude.\nThe xeno-cultists also occasionally shock their own \nmembers with stray hits. This does not happen frequently \nenough to incur significant Magnitude Damage, but \ndoes leave a string of charred corpses on the floor.\n66\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\n67\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nOPTIONAL ENcOUNTER: \nTHE cOLD TRADE\nAs Mediator Dyne indicates, Kar’thir has a flourishing population \nof xenos artefact traffickers. The underground business started \nwhile Lord Militant Achilus still lived and the Crusade was \ncelebrating new, stunning victories regularly. Resources poured \ninto rebuilding Karlack in the Imperial image, bringing droves \nof the wealthy and politically connected to claim a stake in the \nplanet’s future. The inundated natives quickly realised that the \ntrinkets they sometimes unearthed fetched high prices with \ncertain elements of these newcomers. The Crusade was too \noccupied with securing their hold on the planet and the Salients \nto delve into native commerce, and Karlack’s status as a fortress \nworld made it the ideal hub for a black market. As long as \nthe merchants were careful, they could operate literally under \nthe Imperium’s nose. This situation drew the attention of the \nTranspired Circle, and Alexei Drahj has slowly been amassing \nwealth and power in Kar’thir.\nThe rudimentary luxury of the Foreigner’s Triangle does not \nmeet Drahj’s refined standards. He resides in orbit on his cruiser, \nthe Frozen Tear, shuttling to and from the surface to conduct his \nbusiness. The corrupt trader protects himself with an entourage \nof bodyguards. Their profiles along with his can be found on \npage 88. It is possible to find Drahj in several of Kar’thir’s locales, \nmost notably the Obsidian Pavilion. However, his exchange \npoint at the unfinished basilica is the least public of these and \nthus the best place to catch him in the act.\nunfiniShed BuSineSS\nDrahj uses the unfinished basilica for illicit deals. If Dyne sets up \na meeting, Drahj arranges it for the dark hours of the morning. \nIt is up to the Battle-Brothers whether they want Dyne to \nactually go to the site or lay some other form of ambush. If the \nKill-team decides to lie in wait before the criminal arrives, they \nfind his enhanced senses harder to fool than they might have \nexpected. Make the appropriate Opposed Tests. Drahj brings six \nbodyguards with him. If he arrives first, two remain at his side \nwhile the other four position themselves in the girders of the \nincomplete building.\nViolence erupts at the first sight of a Space Marine, and Drahj \nfights fiercely for his inhuman life. He knows even if the Space \nMarines took him alive, his nature would still condemn him. He \nthrows pretence to the wind and uses every gift at his disposal.\nFighting within the unfinished basilica Administratum is \nprecarious. Each of the six levels is 8 metres above the next, and \nwide and deep enough for such parameters to be irrelevant. What \nis relevant is that none of the stories above the ground have been \nfinished; they are only cross works of girders. Each beam is 15 \ncentimetres wide, and they form a grid of squares 4 metres to a \nside. This provides sufficient footing for stationary fire, but melee \ncombat, Dodging, and Movement all run a risk of falling (see \nTable 2–2). If firing between levels, the beams provide AP 25 \ncover to the Body of any target directly above or below the firer.\nDrahj’s shuttle (parked with all the others on the edge of the \ncity) holds a stasis box where he keeps his most interesting wares. \nIt is sealed with a gene-coded lock, but getting a biological sample \nis hopefully not a difficulty (one way or another) after the fight. \nThe box contains one or more of the following:\n• A staff topped with crescent blades, extremely similar to \nthe sceptre in Inquisitor Vincent’s notes.\n• A small field projector of some kind. Its black casing \nis smooth, and the dull green runes on it have been \nunpowered for centuries. An Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use \nTest notices some similarities between the item and a \ndilation field.\n• The broken stock of a xenos rifle. The weapon is forged \nfrom a dark, sleek metal. A set of coils vaguely resembling \nthe inside of a suspensor sit near the grip.\n• A Tau pulse carbine rifle\nThe Deathwatch is certainly within its rights to execute \nany survivors, or ample authorities exist on Karlack to turn the \ncriminals over to. As well, the disposition of the technology \ncache is up to the Kill-team.\nthe tranSpired CirCle\nThe planet Transpire sits at the edge of the Deserter’s Coil, \none more husk of a planet slowly being repopulated by all \nthe Reach’s worst elements. Transpire holds the region’s \ntypical pockets of aspiring Chaos devotees, but it is also \nhome to one of the Reach’s largest trading posts for xenos \ntechnology. The loose cartel calling itself the Transpired \nCircle was founded here from natives of the Jericho Reach, \nImperial deserters and a few ambitious, unscrupulous \ntraders drawn from far away. Alexei Drahj is simply one \nmember of the Circle’s inner ring. This handful of men and \nwomen keep hold of their power only by making the most \nvile deals with Chaos.\nThe Transpired Circle secretly references the device \nunearthed on its planet of origin by its founding members. \nThis blasphemous alien relic corrupts the human form, \ngranting inhuman gifts to the few who manage to survive \nthe process. However, it is said that after the carefully \nshrouded ritual of initiation, no one is ever quite the same. \nTheir behaviours change slowly over the years, with the \noldest members of the inner circle now using their ill-\ngotten fortunes to pursue agendas no man can fathom.\nDrahj himself is one such survivor, now a xenos \nperversion in human skin. He balances his arrogance with \ncharm, at least in the presence of the Adeptus Astartes. \nTable 2–2: Actions in the Unfinished \nBasilica\nActionAcrobatics or Agility Test\n†\nMelee (per Round)Routine (+20)\nHalf Move or DodgingOrdinary (+10)\nFull MoveChallenging (+0)\nRun or ChargeDifficult (–10) \n†\nActivating the magnetised boot soles of Astartes power armour \nnegates the need for these tests but has the usual effect on Move-\nment.\n68\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nA Trail to the \nSouth\nSolidarity is our shield. Loyalty is our weapon. The bonds of duty \nhold stronger than steel.\n–From the Oath of Loyalty\nT\nhe Kill-team’s final objective is probably not a surprise \nto them: follow the impostor Space Marines to the \nsunken city. If the Kill-team does not naturally gravitate \ntowards trying to find this mysterious location, the GM has \nseveral options for pointing them towards it:\n•Deciphering the glyphs in the carved tunnels\n•A series of anomalous seismic tremors have been wracking \nthe southern hemisphere, causing rampant destruction \nand tidal waves. Imperial diviners and the Geomancers \nalike attribute it to something more than natural activity.\n•If any of the Reborn are left alive, at least one of them \nis aware that many of their brethren are preparing for a \n“Great Awakening” somewhere in the south. Interrogating \nor Intimidating this information out of the survivors is an \nOrdinary (+10) task.\n•Sometimes, the simplest methods are the best. Inquisitor \nQuist (if she lives), General Iacton, Mediator Dyne, or \nany other allied party may simply point out that the \ncity was Vincent’s primary interest, and there is a good \nchance that the enemy is seeking it.\nHowever, the southern oceans are a large place, and the \nruins beneath it are legend—and legends rarely come with \nmap coordinates. The Alpha Legion expended a great deal of \neffort to learn about and gain access to the location. Finding \nthe ruins is not trivial for the Kill-team either. Any of the \nNPCs knowledgeable about the planet suggests that the \nKar’dane Monitoring Bulwarks are most likely to have what \nthey need to reach the sunken city. \nTHE KAR’DANE ISLANDS\nThe Kar’dane archipelago chain is home to the Crusade’s \nonly sizable holdings in the southern hemisphere. During \nthe Crusade’s original occupation of the planet, the southern \nislands seemed like an isolated, low-population region ideal for \nlocating expensive and delicate sensor arrays. Consequently, \nmost of the planets’ monitoring and science stations, as well \nas a large portion of the generatoriums for planetary defence \nwere built here. Unfortunately, neither the climate nor the \npopulation behaved as the Crusade expected. Storms and tidal \nwaves have repeatedly damaged the valuable equipment, and \nthe islands proved home to Karlack’s most fractious rebels. \nVariously sized contingents of Planetary Defence Forces are \nstationed at the bulwarks to keep them secure.\nQuist’s shuttle or military vehicles are both available to \ntransport the Kill-team to the archipelago, as well as a pilot \nif they so desire. The islands are rocky, with beaches of \ncoarse, black sand. Many of the landmasses measure only \na few dozen metres in diameter, but those large enough to \nhave what could be called an interior support surprisingly \nlush vegetation. The hardy plants cling to the rock through \nthe thin soil, keeping their roots through storms that have \nravaged the Imperial stations.\nRoughly two dozen stations dot the Kar’dane islands. The \nlargest juts hundreds of metres high in a haphazard jumble \nof antennas and augury dishes patched and re-patched with \nwhatever the attendant Tech-Priests could scrounge. The \nsmallest is little more than a lone vox monitor atop a cylinder \nthat scarcely has room for a single officer to sit inside. \nfinding the Sunken City\nAlthough the Battle-Brothers may not know it yet, getting \ninto the city requires a little more than just finding out where \nit is. What the Battle-Brothers need from the monitoring \nbulwarks depends on how much they know by this point. The \nprerequisites equate to the following Secondary Objectives:\nObjective 1: Determine the city’s exact location. \nThe Battle-Brothers should already be aware they need   \nthis information.\nObjective 2: Acquire transport capable of operating \nin extreme ocean depths. The deepest parts of the ocean \napply pressure far greater than being crushed beneath \nthe foot of a titan. The vacuum pressure differentials that \nspacecraft must withstand come nowhere close to rivalling \nthose in the depths of Karlack’s oceans. Reaching the city \nrequires a submersible vehicle specifically built to withstand   \nextreme pressure. \n69\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nObjective 3: Find a way to enter the tomb city. \nInquisitor Vincent’s box originally contained a sigil that \nunlocks the city’s outer doors. Since that is now in the \npossession of the Alpha Legion, the Battle-Brothers need an \nalternate means of entry. Hopefully they already have this \ninformation from Vincent’s note or Dyne, but if they do not, \nanother opportunity to learn lies in the archipelago. \nThe monitoring bulwarks below present possible avenues \nfor fulfilling these Objectives, although the GM and his \nplayers may devise other options.\nthe kal’thane Bulwark \nKal’thane Island is also called Mount Kal’thane, as it is actually \na dormant volcano. Its variation from the other real islands \nleaves it isolated, with no other land masses in sight. The \nmonitoring station nests in the crater at the cone’s summit. \nEven though Magos Geomancer Quezalt has no official rank \nwith the PDF, he is clearly in command of the dozen troops \nstationed in a facility packed with sophisticated cogitators, \naugur arrays, and data processors.\nKarlack is of interest for the Geomancers for two reasons: the \nunusual seismic and tidal activity in the south and as Quezalt \nputs it, “the opportunity to witness a greatly accelerated decay \nof the natural geologic state due to modernisation.” Quezalt \nis the most senior of his order on the planet, and although \nhe has not been bothered yet by cultists, Quezalt knows it \nis a possibility if the southern region is not brought under \ncontrol, and thus he would be very receptive to the Kill-team’s \nneeds—if he didn’t have more pressing concerns.\nThe seismic activity that drew the Geomancers here has \ngrown from interesting to dangerous. Whatever is happening in \nInquisitor Vincent’s city beneath the sea is causing catastrophic \nearthquakes and tidal waves in the southern hemisphere. The \nKal’thane bulwark is in real danger of being swallowed by the \nvolcano it resides in. The problems are immediately evident \nwhen the Kill-team arrives, as tremors wrack the island. Small \navalanches of dirt and basalt rock constantly slide down the \nslope of the cone. Magos Quezalt does not throw away this \nOmnissiah-sent chance to preserve himself and his work. After \nthe Battle-Brothers explain their purpose, he says:\n“Tautology: I would take readings if I could. The erratic seismic \nphenomenon exceed this facility’s structural limits. They also \ndisrupt the machine spirits’ concentration. Their augur readings \nwill be inaccurate as long as the activity continues to measure \nabove sixty point four on the vibration index. The activity \nis currently four times this limit, and I calculate that it will \ncontinue to escalate.”\nQuezalt explains that the seismic activity has been growing \nin intensity for the last few days. The volcano sits on a fault \nline, and all the Magos’s analysis indicates that it will soon \ncollapse in on his location. He does not spend long on other \ntopics before getting to the mutually beneficial option:\n“Both our problems arrive at the same solution. I have isolated \nthe main fault line through the island. The local plates can be \nstabilized for a period of two years by large magnitude applications \nof opposing force. Such as—” The Magos is interrupted by a \nthunderous rumbling. Several loud impacts clang against the side \nof the facility. Quezalt rushes to his cogitators and pours over a \nticker stream of binary. He looks up from the thin print out as \nit continues to spew from the machine, and resumes his sentence \ncalmly. “Such as explosives. I have already placed sixteen of the \ntwenty necessary devices. However, the last four seismic pivots \nremain beyond my physical capacity to reach. Were individuals \nsuch as you able to place the four charges, I can initiate the \nstabilisation. Consider in your timing: a seismic wave is about to \nreach us that will submerge this island in eight minutes.”\nThere are four remaining points on the island where charges \nmust be planted. The Magos initiates a hololithic display of \nthe island and points the locations out, briefly describing \neach. (The Circumstance column of the Quick Reference \nhandout for this Mission gives the amount of detail the Kill-\nteam receives.) The charges may be placed in any order, but \nall the tasks must be complete before the shockwave hits. All \nof the locations involve some sort of challenge in placing the \ncharge (or the Magos would have done it himself ). Some of \nthese tasks might benefit from having multiple Battle-Brothers \nworking together, but if they do not split their numbers at \nall, chances are slim that they will be able to finish before the \nseismic wave destroys the facility. \n+++To: Deathwatch Operatives+++\n+++From: Lord General Castus Iacton, \nCitadel Primaris+++\n+++Subject: Kard’dane Monitoring \nBulwarks of Note+++\n-Kal’thane Bulwark: A senior member \nof the Geomancers of Vanity resides \nat this bulwark, studying Karlack. \nIt therefore has some of the most \nsophisticated augur arrays available.\n-Kal’dir Bulwark: This may be an \nopportunity for mutual benefit. This \nbulwark has been under assault by \ndeviants of the Reborn for months. The \nlast vox transmission suggested the \nattack may be so relentless because \nthe bulwark has something the xeno-\ncultists want. \n-Kal’vex Bulwark: The largest of the \nbulwarks, Kal’vex also has excellent \nsensor arrays, as well as personnel \nwith extensive experience in the \nsouthern region.\n-Kal’tran Bulwark: Our few dedicated \nwatercraft dock at this bulwark. The \nbulwark should be able to provide you \nwith a submersible that can reach the \nocean floor.\n70\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nThe four deployment points are:\nA Submerged Cavern\nThis deployment point deep beneath the volcano can only \nbe reached by approaching it through a submerged passage \nwith a strong opposing current. Reaching the necessary \nlocation is an Extended Test requiring 4 successful Difficult \n(–10) Swim Tests. Each Test represents 30 seconds. The \nonly benefit to having multiple Battle-Brothers attempt this \ndeployment is two chances of someone succeeding. \nA Narrow Crevice\nThis deployment point is deep within the volcano cone. A narrow \nfissure provides an opening to the location, but the 60 metre \nlong path to it is only centimetres wider than the charge itself. \nMagos Quezalt provides a special launcher for firing the charges \nover long distances, but the cumbersome reload process takes 60 \nseconds. Making the shot with the launcher is an Arduous (–40) \nBallistic Skill Test. The firer may use the Aim action, but the \ntime necessary increases by a factor of 6 (30 seconds for +10 /60 \nseconds for +20) due to the complexity of lining up the shot. Any \nabilities that reduce the difficulty of a Called Shot also reduce this \nshot’s difficulty. Assistance from a second Battle-Brother halves \nthe time necessary to reload the launcher. \nA Massive Granite Slab\nThe earthquakes started before Quezalt was able to place the \ncharge in this deployment point, and now the necessary spot \nis covered with a huge piece of granite that broke off from \nthe cliff side. Pushing it out of the way to drop the charge is \nan Extended Strength Test requiring 4 successful Arduous \n(–40) Strength Tests. Each Test represents 30 seconds. \nNormal rules for assistance apply.\nAn Elevated Cave\nThis cave in the volcano’s side is at the most unstable part of the \nisland. The cave is already well on its way to collapsing, and a \nconstant hail of stone and stalactites rain from its ceiling. The \ncharge must be planted at a location 500 metres back in the \ncavern. If the Battle-Brother does not adequately avoid the largest \nchunks of falling rubble, he is constantly buffeted and knocked \ndown, greatly impeding his progress forward. Determine how far \nthe Battle-Brother(s) can Run in one minute by taking his Agility \nBonus x 36. Running through the cave requires a Challenging \n(+0) Dodge Test each minute. Failure indicates that for the next \nminute, the Battle-Brother only moves at his Full Move speed \n(one third of his Running speed). The only benefit to having \nmultiple Battle-Brothers attempt this deployment is two chances \nof someone succeeding.\nBy the time the Battle-Brothers get their instructions and \nreach the deployment points, they have only four minutes left \nto complete the tasks at hand. However, all the locations except \nthe narrow crevice require one minute to get clear of the blast \nradius. Anyone who does not deploy their charge within three \nminutes may continue trying, but if all the charges are deployed \nby the four minute mark, Quezalt still detonates them regardless \nof who might be caught in it. Anyone who does not get clear of \nthe blast takes 8d10 I Damage. Because of the distance between \nthe deployment points, there is not sufficient time for a character \nto change locations before the quake hits. The Quezalt has a large \nsupply of charges, and therefore these are never a limiting factor. \nClever solutions (for example, flying through the cave with a jump \npack) should be rewarded with bonuses or automatic success.\nIf they fail, their pilot has the good sense to lift off ahead of \ntime, but the bulwark and all its venerated machines are doomed. \nThe volcano walls collapse in on the crater, crushing the station \n(and possibly Magos Quezalt as well). The Kill-team must get the \ncoordinates some other way.\nIf the island is stabilised, the Magos expertly performs their \nrequest, and in short order indicates that the epicentre of the \ndisturbances lies deep within the Sinner’s Trench. He gives them \nthe exact coordinates, and notes that his machine spirits also divine \na large amount of non-native rock formations at that point. \nthe kal’dir Bulwark\nKal’dir is one of the largest islands in the archipelago, and offers \nplenty of thick jungle for the Reborn rebels to hide within. The \nxeno-cultist fighting force has maintained their siege of this modest \ncoastal bulwark for months on end. Their vox transmitters were \ndestroyed early in the conflict. Since that time, the station’s most \nsenior officer, Lieutenant Tiron, has learned precisely why Kal’dir \nis such a priority target. They sit directly above a small trove of \nUndying technology. Tiron has sealed the heretical cache, so he \ndoes not understand its true value. The contents are not weapons, \nbut marble tablets and icons of worship. Most significantly, the \ncache contains an inscribed octahedron identical to the one in \nthe geoManCerS of vanity\nThe ruined world of Vanity is home to a constant battle \nfor possession between the Achilus Crusade and its \nenemies. The lethal radiation and burnt-out geography \nare key obstacles to both sides, as they kill most soldiers \nbefore they can be of any use. The Adeptus Mechanicus \nhas established a small subterranean enclave in one of \nthe planet’s most poisoned regions. Here, they study \nthe nature of rock and earth, hoping to find knowledge \nin the wasteland that can be turned to a martial victory. \nThis order calls themselves Geomancers. They can be \nfound to a smaller extent on other worlds in the Jericho \nReach, studying unusual geologies and terrains.\nadjuSting the deployMent \npointS\nThis encounter was designed for at least five Battle-\nBrothers. For a Kill-team of four (or if only one Battle-\nBrother attempts the Massive Granite Slab) drop the \nStrength Test Difficulty to –30. If the Kill-team has \nthree or less members, lower the Granite Slab difficulty \nand reduce the number of deployment locations to the \nsize of the Kill-team.\n71\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nVincent’s notes—another sigil key. This artefact is a key in both \na literal and metaphoric sense. In addition to opening the tomb \ncity, the runes on its exterior unlock the cipher from the carved \ntunnels under Kar’thir. If any of the Battle-Brothers detected the \nmathematical theme in those reliefs and recorded the images, he \ncan use the key to determine the sunken city’s location without \nfurther information by making a Difficult (–10) Ciphers \n(Xenos Markings) Test. \nOf course getting into the bulwark means the Battle-Brothers \nfirst need to get past the force laying siege to it. The Kal’dir xeno-\ncultists are far better organised than their brethren in Kar’thir, and \npossess heavy weapons for breaching the fortified facility. (See the \nMilitant Rebel profile on page 90, and use it to form a Horde.)\nIf the Battle-Brothers break the cultists’ siege, Tiron gladly \nrids himself of the materials that made his installation such a \ntarget. If the Kill-team managed to get inside while the assault \nstill continues, Tiron is not so cooperative. The bulwark is running \nlow on supplies, and he knows he and his men are dead without \nintervention. Driven by desperation, he draws his pistol and \nshakily demands that the Battle-Brothers deal with the xeno-cult \nat his doors before he opens the seal (which truthfully poses little \nbarrier to the Adeptus Astartes warriors).\nthe kal’vex Bulwark\nThe Kal’vex bulwark takes up every centimetre of its small \nisland and extends precariously out over the ocean. This region \nof islands is particularly wracked with storms, and the bulwark \nhas become more haphazard with every emergency repair. The \nsituation only declined when the Tech-priests grew offended \nat the state of affairs and forsook Kal’vex. Since that time it has \nrelied on technomats and rough emulations of witnessed tech-\nrites to keep the facility together. \nWhen the Battle-Brothers arrive, one of the region’s typical \nstorms rages. Have their craft’s pilot make a Challenging (+0) \nPiloting Test to avoid sustaining damage to the vehicle while \nlanding. The station’s personnel are baffled by the arrival of \nthe Adeptus Astartes, clearly trying to understand what could \npossibly warrant a visit to their run-down post. Once they \nunderstand that the Space Marines want to use their augury \nsystems, a pall of awkward silence falls across the crew. \nFinally, one of them reveals that all such systems were long \nago plundered for components to appease the aqua processors, \nstabilisers, and other vital machine spirits of the bulwark. \nHowever, if the Kill-team reveals their interest in rumours of \nthe sunken city, the staff directs them to an unusual guest.\nThe castaway\nThe Battle-Brothers are led to a small but neat room furnished \nwith a cot and chest. The nameless refugee inside washed up \non the bulwark a few months ago, terribly injured and mostly \ninsane with starvation and exposure. He has said enough in \nhis ramblings for the station’s men to glean that he survived a \nshipwreck far out to sea. Over time, he began to speak of a city \nbeneath the ocean with fervent certainty. He has demanded to \nbe taken there several times. Through all of this, he has never \ngiven his name. The PDF officers apologetically suggest that \nmaybe he can tell them something about their objectives.\nRead aloud or paraphrase the following:\nThe man slouches on the cot, his back pressed to the corner of \nthe room. He is wearing coveralls obviously borrowed from the \nbulwark’s occupants. They hang on his malnourished frame; his \nskin is flaking and sallow, and his eyes are lost in the terror of \nsomeplace very far from here. When he sees you, he whimpers and \ndraws into himself. A small, pleading noise begins to repeatedly \ncome from his lips. “No no no no no no.”\nOnly when he sights their Deathwatch shoulder plates \ndoes his reaction change. His eyes fixate on the silver symbol, \nand he stares in childlike wonder. If the Battle-Brothers \nhave already been to Surbryte’s camp in Kar’dane, then \nthey recognise the man immediately. It is Inquisitor Vincent. \nDepending on the topic, roleplaying, and Interaction Tests, \nbelow are some responses they may garner:\nWho are you?\n“It’s better not to remember. I know what I used to be. So proud. \nSo foolish. At the end, I was weak.”\nWhat happened to you?\n“No less than I deserved. No less than all men like me deserve. But \noh, the pain. I wasn’t ready to be judged. I wasn’t ready to die, not \nrotting in the dark with the old ones. I have failed.”\nDid you go to the city in the sea?\n“I-I don’t know. I saw it so clearly while the water filled my \nlungs. But seeing is not being. They go. Yes. Yes. Your dark \nbrothers go.”\nWhat is in the sunken city?\n“The old ones.” He lets out a creaking laugh that turns into a \nhacking cough. “The Undying.”\nHow do we reach the sunken city?\nHe shudders. “That is always the question, always what you want \nto know. I told you, didn’t I? Told you about the key.” A few \ntears trickle down his hollow, sunburnt cheeks. “God-Emperor \ncurse me, I gave you the key.”\n72\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nAbout The Augurs...\nWhile the castaway is an interesting find, any directions \nhe might provide are certainly less than reliable. A visual \ninspection of the stripped sensorium arrays easily reveals that \nthey could be re-assembled by anyone with the Tech-Use \nskill, and perhaps even by the technomats who took them \napart in the first place. Unfortunately, the PDF crew draws \nthe line at letting their painfully re-constructed technology \nbe torn apart. They aren’t foolish enough to directly oppose \nthe Adeptus Astartes with force, but do everything they can \nto sabotage modifications done without their consent. Such \nmischief might include: loosening the exterior scaffolds while \nthe Space Marines try to work, creating power overloads, and \nthrowing garbage down from upper ports, and harsh language. \nTheir cooperation may be gained through exceptional \npersuasion, or with a Very Hard (–30) Tech-Use Test to lay \nout a plan for repairing both the augurs and the vital systems \nin a manner that leaves both functional. \nMaking the repairs requires 15 hours minus the Degrees \nof Success on a Tech-Use Test. This time can be halved if the \nbulwark’s remaining two technomats assist. It also requires \nthe implementer(s) to climb through the jumbled scaffolds of \nthe exterior in the raging storm to make the modifications. \nEveryone who does this must make a Difficult (–10) Climb \nTest or plunge into the roiling sea. Any technomats who fall \nare lost to the waves. However, a Battle-Brother may attempt \na Swim Test (with the usual modifiers for armour, see page \n208 in the Deathwatch Rulebook) to make his way back to \nthe rigging. Even if he fails, his life sustainers easily keep him \nalive until he can flounder back along the ocean floor.\nOnce the Augur Arrays have been re-assembled, a Difficult \n(–10) Scrutiny Test is needed to interpret the readings from \nthese patched machine spirits in the turbulent weather. If the \nKill-team waits for the storm to subside (which is does in \n1d10 hours), the Test is only Challenging (+0). If they can \ncoerce Vincent into giving them jumbled directions on where \nto scan, they gain a +20 bonus to the Test.\nthe kal’tran Bulwark\nThe Kal’tran bulwark is not immediately visible on approach \nto the mid-sized island. Most of the complex is built into \nthe submerged rock of the island, with several docking bays \nand glassteel observation ports. A small, square building \non the mainland contains the hatch which leads into   \nthe installation.\nA tall, lean man called Senior Docktender Orvel meets the \nKill-team. He makes a clumsy salute as he tries to imitate \nwhat he has seen the Crusade forces do. When the Battle-\nBrothers bring up the bulwark’s deep sea transport, his face \nseems to grow slightly green. Reluctantly, he informs them \nof the situation.\nKal’tran is supposed to be home to the most advanced \ndeep sea vessel on the planet, the Jericho Cathurian class \nsubmersible. However, it is also home to the largest force \nof Reborn insurgents on the planet—and they have stolen \nthe Cathurian. Submersibles are not common vehicles in \nthe Imperial armoury, and the Cathurian is rare even among \nsubmersibles. If the city is located in a deep part of the ocean \n(and the Battle-Brothers know it is if they have already \nobtained the location coordinates), Senior Docktender \nOrvel certainly knows of no other methods to transport   \nthem there.\nThe theft happened only a few days ago. Much to the \nPDF’s shame, a Reborn cultist had existed in their midst, \nand he allowed his fellows to gain access to the submersible. \nBy the time Orvel and his men realised what happened, \nthe Cathurian was already headed out to sea. The Senior \nDocktender admits that he suspects where the rebels have \nthe submersible, but does not have the men or firepower to \nreclaim it. The Reborn have several holdings on the island, \nbut only one that borders the water. If the Battle-Brothers \ncan retrieve the Cathurian or simply secure the area where it \nis being kept, Orvel will gratefully provide a trained crew to \ntake them wherever they want to go.\nwhat Can Break an inquiSitor?\nMighty though they are, bastions of iron will and the \njudges of whole planets—Inquisitors are still men. Vincent \nspent months being tortured by a Chaos Space Marine, \nand ultimately betrayed his sacred vows. He destroyed \none sigil key to keep his captors from obtaining it, but he \neventually broke and told his tormenter how to retrieve \nthe second one stored at the Citadel. (He didn’t plan on \nthem poisoning the box.) Once the Alpha Legion had a \nkey, Vincent directed them to a location far out in the \nsouthern seas. This location was not the sunken tomb city, \nbut a turbulent field of deep sea vents. The Inquisitor’s \nintent was to see both his foes and himself lost forever \nbeneath Karlack’s restless ocean. In this too he failed. \nTheir vessel was ill-prepared. It did sink, and the Chaos \nSpace Marines did perish, but Rize read the Inquisitor’s \njournals at Citadel Primaris. He gleaned enough to use \nthe cipher key on the carvings beneath the Cenotaph, \nand find the real location on his own. Furthermore, cruel \nchance spared Vincent the watery grave that claimed his \ncaptors. He survived the crash, barely. His guilt and the \nweeks he spent adrift in Karlack’s ocean have depleted his \nphysical and mental reserves.\nwhat doeS he know?\nWhen his faculties were fully intact, Vincent learned that \nthe Reborn’s “Undying” mythos was rooted in a grain of \ntruth. Karlack obviously contains the ruins of an ancient \ncivilisation, but Vincent began to suspect that some of the \naliens might still be alive, in hiding or in stasis. When he \npainstakingly tracked down their suspected location, the \nmythical sunken city, he also learned that it was impossible \nto enter without a sigil key. Unfortunately Lamdus Rize \nwas also looking for any trace of this xenos race. When \nhe learned that the Inquisitor had already done the hard \nwork for him, he had Ilvaris lure the Inquisitor and his \ncadre into a trap. How much of this Vincent remembers \nnow is questionable.\n73\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nThe Reborn Encampment\nThe costal encampment of the Reborn militants is on the other \nside of the island. Their leader, Feynir Surbryte, is overseeing the \nsite personally. It is not coincidence that Surbryte’s forces stole the \nCathurian at this juncture, because they are headed to the same \nlocation as the Deathwatch. The Alpha Legion’s best intelligence \n(largely drawn from Dahzak’s divinations) suggests that a massive \nnumber of souls may have to be sacrificed to resurrect the xenos \nfrom their tombs. With the submersible in their possession, the \nReborn have been steadily sending their members to the sunken \ncity. What worshipper of the Undying wouldn’t want to be a \npart of awakening their beloved patrons? The xeno-cult’s leader,   \nfor one.\nThe man presently going by Feynir Surbryte is cosmopolitan \nenough to know good never comes from disturbing powerful \nbeings. His time serving the Alpha Legion on this planet is \ngrowing to a close. Soon it will be time to take on a new identity \nand further the Legion’s fractious agenda on another world. His \nlast duty is to funnel his flock into the sunken ruins as fodder for \nLamdus Rize’s plan.\nThe encampment can be reached by taking a sea vessel around \nthe island, or by crossing through its jungle on foot. Several dozen \nidentical beige tents are pitched along the sandy white beach. \nMost of them are similar on the inside: a few bedrolls, a weapon \ncleaning kit, and perhaps a handful of personal items. However, \none such tent belongs to Yale Ilvaris, and it is considerably more \ninteresting (see opposite). The sand covers thirty metres between \nthe tree line and the murky ocean. Once this beach might have \nbeen idyllic, but decades of manufacturing, construction, and \nrunoff from over-farming show their effects in the south as well. \nThe choppy water is a brackish green-brown, and dead fish line \nthe shore. The Cathurian is hard to miss, its grey hull rising above \nthe water line a few dozen metres out. \nMines ring the encampment. If the Battle-Brothers approach \nby land, roll an Opposed Test between their Awareness and an \neffective Concealment Skill of 55. Success means they spot the \nmines and are able to avoid them. On a failure, everyone in the \nvicinity takes 3d10 X Damage with a Penetration of 2. Moreover, \ntheir presence is revealed to the xeno-cultists, who quickly rush \nout into combat.\nBattling the Reborn\nThe camp is a wide, open stretch of sand dotted with tents. \nEach tent is 2 metres wide and tall; the tents obscure sight, \nbut do not provide any significant AP if used as cover. If a \nBattle with the Reborn breaks out, it has two distinct sets of \nAdversaries. The first is a Magnitude 36 Horde of militant \ncultists. The second is Feynir Surbryte and the other senior \nmembers of the Reborn. The senior xeno-cultists number \n1 less than the number of Battle-Brothers. Use the Militant \nRebel Cultist profile on page 90 to construct the Horde, and \nindividual Militant Rebel Cultists equipped with Cult Weapons \nfor the senior members. The Horde forms a protective ring \naround their leaders, shielding their enlightened leaders with \ntheir bodies. Assume this ring is 8 metres from the outer edge \nto the inner edge. Until this mass of xeno-cultists breaks, the \nKill-team cannot advance on the leaders in the centre, and all \nranged attacks on them incur a –30 Penalty.\nThe senior xeno-cultists have managed (with help from \ntheir Alpha Legion patrons) to salvage a few working pieces \nof the Undying’s advanced technology. Their alien weapons \npose a far graver threat than the xeno-cultists’ guns. Surbryte \nand his closest devotees wield sleek rifles with a vibrant \ngreen chamber inset in the barrel. They emit wide beams of \ndisintegrating energy. This deadly polarised lightning scours \naway skin and armour more efficiently than the most caustic \nacid. Layer by layer the target’s molecular bonds break. \nStarting with the armour, then the skin, then his insides, the \nvictim’s body turns into gaseous particles that bond with the \nbeam of the weapon. If no Battle-Brothers are struck by a \nflayer rifle in the first Round of combat, the GM may want to \nassume a xeno-cultist took a stray hit so he can still describe \nthe lurid effects.\nThe Traitor’s Bargain\nA survivor to the end, Ilvaris hangs onto life (by burning his \nlast Fate Point) after all his followers go down. He squints \nup at the Angels of Death looming over his injured body, \nand decides it may be time to rethink his allies. If the Battle-\nBrothers come near him after fighting the xeno-cult leaders, \nread aloud or paraphrase the following:\nSurbryte’s breathing is shallow, but he still breathes. He winces up \nat you with a look of resignation. “Will you hear me out before \nyou dispense your justice, favoured of the God-Emperor?”\nfeynir SurBryte\nFeynir Surbryte is only the latest identity of the \nman born Yale Ilvaris. Ilvaris is the definition of an \nopportunist. Born on a small planet in the corona of the \nHadex Anomaly, he drifted from one cult to another, \nwith an innate knack for choosing the winning side. \nMore pragmatic than dogmatic, his talents eventually \nbrought him into an alliance with the Alpha Legion. \nDestabilisation through cults and unrest is a key strategy \nfor this Traitor Legion. In exchange for such luxuries \nas juvenat treatments, Ilvaris has roused discontent and \nfurthered the Alpha Legion’s cause from within on more \nthan a dozen worlds.\nIlvaris and his Feynir Surbryte persona are to thank \nfor the prominence of the Reborn on Karlack. The \nbastion of Imperial might makes an obvious target of \ninterest for the Alpha Legion. For reasons not revealed \nto Ilvaris, the Chaos Space Marines had a particular \ninterest in the planet’s xenos legacy even before they \nagreed to help with Dahzak’s plan. It was for this \nreason they directed his efforts specifically towards the \nReborn. Through their puppet, the Alpha Legion has \ntaught the cultists how to repair and operate some of \nthe powerful “Undying” artefacts they have unearthed. \nThrough Ilvaris’s training and charismatic leadership, \nthe zealous xeno-cult has developed a sizable contingent \nof competent fighters. \n74\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nIlvaris makes a bid for his life. He paints himself as the victim \nof cruel fortune. Born under the heel of Chaos in the Charon \nStars, he had no choice but to serve the region’s foul masters. \nThrough all this, he never truly gave his soul over to the dark \npowers, a fact he encourages them to verify by checking his \nbody for the marks of Chaos (of which he has none). To try \nto prove his worth, he offers to reveal everything he knows \nabout the Alpha Legion and the Reborn. Below are facts he \nmay disclose:\n•The Reborn were nothing until Lamdus Rize sent Ilvaris \nto organise them. They would never have gotten any of \nthe alien technology working if the Alpha Legion hadn’t \nshown them how.\n•Ilvaris doesn’t know much about what the Undying really \nare, but Rize seems to have suspicions. For many years \nthey were nothing but a mythical idol to rally behind. \nThen Rize joined with some organisation on Samech. \nSuddenly, he became far more interested in the aliens that \nused to inhabit Karlack, and driven to discover sites related \nto them.\n•Rize lured Vincent into an ambush here in the southern \nislands. He killed most of the Inquisitor’s cadre, and spent \nmonths trying to learn what Vincent knew about the city \nbeneath the sea. Ultimately, the Inquisitor folded. Ilvaris \nisn’t sure what happened after that, but just a few days \nago Rize directed him to acquire the Cathurian and begin \nshipping his followers out on it. Ilvaris doesn’t know where \nthey’re going, but he knows they aren’t coming back. \nIf the Kill-team lets him keep talking, he vows to repent \nhis evil ways. He may even mean it, at the GM’s discretion—\nparticularly if the Deathwatch Space Marines give him reason \nto think they can point him towards a brighter future than \nbeing the Alpha Legion’s agent provocateur forevermore. He \ncontinues trying to negotiate for his life until the Kill-team \neither accepts, or silences him.\nIlvaris’s Tent\nThe xeno-cult’s phony leader lived in much the same fashion \nas the rest of the Reborn; his furnishings and possessions \nseem typical of those elsewhere in the camp. However, an \nOrdinary (+10) Search Test reveals two items of interest. \nIf the Kill-team made a deal with Ilvaris then he points \neverything out himself in a guided tour. \nWeapons Locker: Ilvaris left this innocuous case under \nhis cot unlocked in his rush to join the fray outside. It contains \nindentations shaped to store his wraithblade and temporal \ndistorter. It also contains a needle pistol with several doses of \nvirulent poisons, and a thick glove covered in spikes that taper \nto needle-thin points. The inside of the lid is scarred with \noxidation. Once it displayed an etched marking, but someone \ndeliberately burned it away.\nData Crystal: This crystal contains pict recording from \nRize’s interrogations of Inquisitor Vincent. A sampling of the \ncontents includes:\nDated ten months previous:\nThe picter shows the nondescript interior of a beige tent. A man \nwith a neatly kept beard stands straight-backed in the frame. A large \nfigure crosses close to him, looming. The Chaos Space Marine’s \narmour is bears a blue and green scale pattern. He takes off his \nhelmet, revealing short blond hair. He speaks calmly. “We each \nhave the ability to inconvenience each other, Inquisitor. You could \ntake a good deal of my time—time I would rather not lose. And I, \nI could take a good deal of your flesh. Flesh I assume you would \nrather not lose. So I propose we both depart this tent now, with all \nour assets intact. Just tell me, how do I find the xenos monoliths?”\nDated four months ago:\nThe picter shows the same tent, and the remnants of the same \nbearded man. A metal rack has been brought into the tent, and he \nhangs from it by metal shackles that appear to have been welded \non around his wrists. His withered, bloody body shows that the \nTraitor kept his promise. His captor enters, carrying a shaggy \nobject. He tosses it at the Inquisitor’s feet, and the face of a dead \nwoman stares up. “That was the last of them. She mentioned \nsomething quite interesting in her last screams, however. She \nseemed to think the sigil you destroyed wasn’t the only one you \nfound. Tell me about this second key.”\nDated three weeks ago:\nThe picter zooms in very close in on the Inquisitor’s face, which is \ndrawn in pain and drenched with sweat. Out of sight, something \nmakes a strange buzzing whine—like the hybrid of a shrieking \nanimal and a bone saw. “No more...” his hoarse voice is like \ngravel. “There is... There is another key.” The noise stops, giving \nway to expectant silence. “It’s at the Citadel—in my chambers.” \nThe view remains fixed, but off-screen the Alpha Legion warrior \nspeaks. “Then we shall go and acquire it. Then you will take us \nto the tombs.” \nthe alpha legion\nOf all the accursed Legions who turned from the light of \nthe Emperor during the Horus Heresy, the Alpha Legion \nremains the most enigmatic. Their emblem is the Hydra, \nsymbolizing the multi-headed nature of their Legion, with \neach group able to act independently of the others. They \nexcel in infiltration and destabilisation. The practice they \nemployed on Karlack is a common one for them: stirring \nup cults to weaken and distract the target before the Alpha \nLegion launches its attack. \nOne other idiosyncrasy of these Traitors is that they \nstill use their battle cry from times past: “For the Emperor!” \nNeedless to say these words on the lips of betrayers is a \ngrave affront to loyal Space Marines. Most assume this \nreaction is the reason the Alpha Legion use the phrase.\n75\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nAlpha Legion Dreadclaw\nAn Alpha Legion’s Dreadclaw assault pod sits at one end \nof the camp. This flight-capable drop pod is what brought \nthe Traitor squad to the planet, and where they stored their \nequipment. A Challenging (+0) Security Test opens the \nhatch underneath the hull. Cautious and secretive to the last, \nthe Traitor Marines have left little informative on their vessel. \nHowever, a set of storage chests do hold one thing of great \ninterest: the “Black Templar” armour. \nThe baroque, spiked profile of Chaos power armour \nis difficult to disguise no matter how it is painted. For \nthat reason, the Alpha Legion had to acquire armour from \nloyal Adeptus Astartes for their masquerade. Upon closer \ninspection, none of the suits of power armour are actually \nBlack Templar in origin. They come from an eclectic array \nof loyal Chapters—no doubt pillaged from the Battle-\nBrothers who opposed them in past encounters. The GM \ncan decide exactly which Chapters are most interesting, but \nthe list of initial Achilus Crusade forces on page 339 of the \nDeathwatchRulebook makes a good starting point. The \nunique emblems and inscriptions have all been covered with \nthick black paint, and the Black Templars’ white cross symbol \nstencilled on the shoulder pad. A Space Marine’s eye can pick \nout the distinguishing marks underneath the paint and forged \ntabards, but it is easy to understand how those outside the \nAdeptus Astartes would miss the difference.\nDespite their recent service history, these suits appear to be \nuntainted beneath the false colours. They could be returned \nto honourable service either with the Deathwatch or their \nhome Chapters.\nThe cathurian\nThe submersible lies stationary several meters out from shore. \nIts adamantite-grey hull is smooth except for a few embossed \nImperial icons. Two exterior hatches are unlocked. If Ilvaris \nis serious about siding with the Deathwatch, he informs them \nthat a crew of apostate Adeptus Mechanicus await them inside \nthe submersible. Otherwise, whoever enters the ship first may \nbe in for more than one unpleasant surprise. These corrupt \nfollowers of Arch-Magos Vayze are high-ranking Magi on \nSamech. Using the poisonous fruits of forbidden science, each \none of them is not only a master of machines, but a twisted \nchimera of logical order and its antithesis. \nDespite being formidable combatants, their task on Karlack \nis to transport the sacrificial lambs to the sunken tombs and \naid in finding a vector amplifier. Battling Space Marines is an \nunnecessary risk to those priorities. When the Battle-Brothers \nenter the Cathurian they find the dark Tech-Priests scrambling \nto make the vehicle ready for a departure. However, a single \nAlpha Legion Chaos Space Marine oversees the operation. \nUnlike the Magi, the Chaos Space Marine is ready and waiting \nfor his nemeses to arrive. \nBattle in Close Quarters\nTwo Apostate Mechanicus Magi work near the entry hatch \nwhen the Battle-Brothers enter the Cathurian. Unless the \nKill-team is deliberately loud, the Magi are Surprised. The \nhiding Alpha Legion Chaos Space Marine holds his action \nuntil the end of the Round in an attempt to ambush the Kill-\nteam. Only Battle-Brothers who win an Opposed Test of \ntheir Awareness versus his Concealment notice him before \nhe attacks.\nOnce he engages, two more Tech-Priests join him in \ndefending their stolen prize. The area around the entry hatch is \na square four metres on a side. Beyond this are narrow, random, \nsnaking halls. (If the Kill-team entered simultaneously through \nboth hatches then the GM can improvise an intersection of \npassages between the two.) The Chaos Space Marine and the \nApostate Magi attack from the halls, using them for cover. \na hero’S naMe\nThe stolen armour provides an opportunity for the GM \nto plant his own campaign history or hooks for future \nMissions. Many suits of power armour bear the name \nof their owner, and those of particularly venerable \nAdeptus Astartes display identifying heraldry. The \nKill-team may find a set of such armour. It could be the \nproperty of a hero whose fate was heretofore unknown, \nand perhaps provides a link to a duty unfinished that \nthe Battle-Brothers must follow up on. Alternatively, \nperhaps one suit of artificer armour stands out from the \nothers. It obviously belonged to a great hero, but no one \nhas ever heard his name. Who was this Battle-Brother \nand why have all records of his deeds disappeared?\n76\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nFighting in the cramped passageways imposes a –10 penalty \nto the Weapon Skill of all the Hulking combatants, including \nthe Alpha Legion Space Marine. The profiles for this encounter \ncan be found on page 89. The Apostate Magi carry pendants \nbearing the same cog and chaos wheel symbol that the Battle-\nBrothers might have seen in the cave on Aurum.\nTaking the Submersible\nShould the Battle-Brothers fail to clear the Cathurian before \nsignalling Kal’tran to come and retrieve it, the Samech Magi \nattempt to depart in the vessel. A Difficult (–10) Awareness \nTest alerts anyone nearby that the craft’s engines are waking. If it \nis detected early, there is still enough time to make a dash for the \nhatches. Otherwise, the next indication is when the Cathurian \nstarts submerging. At this juncture, the Kill-team must create \nenough breaches that it can’t safely dive, or find some other \nunorthodox way to stop it from getting away.\nAfter the Battle-Brothers seize the Cathurian, they discover \nthe Magi and Chaos Space Marine weren’t alone. The vessel’s \nlocked port hold contains several dozen Reborn cultists who \nwere waiting to join their brethren for the great arising of the \nUndying. The controls for the hold doors are on the bridge, \nand the magi kept said doors locked to avoid unnecessary \ncomplications. The Battle-Brothers can unlock the doors, jettison \nthe xeno-cult passengers, or simply leave them where they are.\nOPTIONAL ENcOUNTER: \nVIPERS IN OUR MIDST\nThe traitor at Kal’tran is not the Reborn’s only inside agent. \nAmong “Surbryte’s” possessions there is a contact list of other \nmembers inside the planet’s military. The longer the Battle-\nBrothers delay in getting this list to Iacton, the greater the chance \nthat these individuals will find out about Surbryte’s defeat and flee \nor cause damage. Most of the bulwarks as well as the Kill-team’s \ntransport have a long-range vox that can send the information \ndirectly back to the Citadel Primaris for immediate action. Lord \nGeneral Iacton replies personally to the transmission. Once he has \nabsorbed the lists, he states that he can take care of most of the \ntraitors, but requests the Battle-Brothers to deal with one serious \nsecurity threat. Isiaah Faln is the master of Malvon bulwark, which \ncontrols a substantial portion of the southern defence grid. Faln \nhas the potential the potential to cause massive damage before \nloyal forces reach him, and due to his proximity to Kal’tran, he \nmay already know about the Reborn’s fall. Iacton asks the Battle-\nBrothers to detour to the nearby island and take Faln down before \nhe does lasting harm.\nMalvon is similar in environment to Kal’tran, only smaller in \nlandmass. Owing to its strategic importance, this bulwark is a \nsquat, heavily fortified structure. Unfortunately for the Kill-team, \nit is also heavily armed, and Faln did indeed receive word of the \nDeathwatch presence in the islands. The PDF troops under his \ncommand wouldn’t know a loyal Space Marine from a traitor, \nand he has taken advantage of that to rally them with a story \nthat mirrors the Kill-team’s initial problems at the Citadel. Faln’s \ntroops believe the region is under assault by Chaos Space Marines, \nand Faln has warned them that these foes of man may try to fool \nthem with lies.\nRead aloud or paraphrase the following when the Battle-\nBrothers get their first look at the bulwark:\nThe octagonal grey structure is roughly two stories tall, and \ntopped with four twin-linked long-barrelled autocannons on \npivoting turrets. A thick wall—4 metres tall and topped with \nrazorwire—surrounds the compound. \nThe Battle-Brothers’ options range from a reckless frontal \nassault to negotiation or guile. Use the following information \nabout the base layout to help in running the encounter. The \nGM may reveal some of this information or offer suggestions \nbased on the success of an Ordinary (+10) Tactics Test. He \nmay wish to roll this Test in secret so that the players are not \nsure of the validity of their information.\nautoCannon eMplaCeMentS\nEach Emplacement does 5d10 +8 X Damage, Pen 6, with \nRange 500, RoF S/2/5 and the Twin-Linked Quality. The \nguns are controlled from a station inside the base, using the \noperators’ Ballistics Skill of 35. Should anyone choose to \nattack the emplacements themselves, they have AP 15 and \nit takes 30 Wounds to destroy one of the barrels. The long \nbarrels prevent a gun from firing at a target directly adjacent \nto the building on which it is mounted, and the weapons \nare never considered Point Blank Range. Similarly, while the \nemplacements’ elevation gives them line of sight over most \nof the compound, anyone staying close to an intervening \nbuilding is obscured.\nMain rooM\nThis octagonal structure has murder slits on the sides which \ndo not have attached passages. Each slit can accommodate \nenough PDF soldiers to form a Horde of Magnitude 10.More \nsoldiers than that are inside the Base, but the size of the slit \nlimits how many can fire at one time. Therefore, the Horde \nmaintains its Magnitude of 10 even if it takes Damage, as \nmore soldiers replace the dead. However, keep track of any \nMagnitude Damage done as it applies to the Magnitude of \nsoldiers faced inside. There is too much noise to attempt \nnormal communication with the soldiers while they are \nfiring. The main room has two access hatches on the roof; \nopening them from the outside requires a Challenging (+0) \nSecurity Test. Opening the main door from outside requires \na Difficult (–10) Tech Use Test.\nSeCondary rooM and oBServatory\nThe secondary building contains the gunnery station for \nthe autocannon emplacements on its lowest level, and the \nCommand Observatory (where Isiaah Faln is located) at the \ntop. Moving between stories takes one Round to traverse the \nstairs. The west side of the ground floor has an escape exit \nthat is not as well secured as the main entrance, but is also \nconcealed from the outside. It can be spotted by anyone on \n77\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nthat side of the complex with a Challenging (+0) Awareness \nTest, and opened with an Ordinary (+10) Security Test. \nWhile most of the base is constructed from materials too \nstrong for personal arms fire to break through, the mirrored \nglassteel panels lining the third story are a weak point, and \nshatter if a single attack does more than 25 points of Damage \nto them.\nperiMeter wall\nReaching the base requires going over or through the thick \nperimeter wall, which is 4 metres high. If climbed, the \nrazorwire does no more than scratch the paint of Astartes \npower armour. Breaching the wall requires dealing 10 Wounds \nof Damage to the same spot after penetrating its AP of 25. \nlanding pad\nThe landing pad is currently empty, and the two control \nconsoles are unmanned. If a Battle-Brother crouches behind a \nconsole at the right angle, he has nearly complete cover from \nall of the turrets. While neither of these consoles house the \ncontrols for the main door, they could be used by a Techmarine \nto interface with the central cogitator. The consoles do have \nvox panels that connect to the main building’s proclaimer \nsystem. A large ascender leads down to the ground level \ncorridor that adjoins the base, but the door here is also sealed \nidentically to the main door. This corridor also has a murder \nslit on either side.\ninSide the BaSe \nand additional faCtS\nThe distance from ground to roof in the base is 8 metres, \nexcept for the Command Observatory which rises another 4 \nmetres above the rest of the roof. The actual Magnitude of the \nHorde of inside the base is 50, less any Magnitude Damage \ndone through the murder slits. However, the confined nature \nof the base gives the Horde an effective Magnitude of 20, \nonly using their actual Magnitude to calculate Breaking \nthresholds. Once face-to-face with the men, the Battle-\nBrothers may also try to persuade them to put down their \nweapons through roleplay or Interaction Skills. Meanwhile, \nas soon as the Kill-team breaches the base, Faln tries to escape \nthrough the secondary building’s side exit.\nwhat SluMBerS Beneath \nkarlaCk\nWarhammer 40,000 fans have almost certainly \nrecognised the architecture and other telltale facets \nof the aliens entombed beneath Karlack. They are \nan ancient race that will one day be dubbed the \nNecrons, and they are anything but the benign entities \nthe “Undying” myths paint them as. Before the rise \nof man, this technologically advanced civilisation \nbegan to worship the C’tan, star gods, who eventually \ntransformed them into a race of living metal hungry \nfor the life force of other beings. \nThe Necrons and their C’tan masters submitted \nthemselves to stasis-sleep millions of years ago, waiting \nfor a fertile time to rise and once again harvest the life \nof the galaxy. The Necrons do not become known to \nthe Warhammer 40,000 universe at large until 897.\nM41 when they begin to wake in force. That is decades \nlater than the current Deathwatch setting. As always \nthe GM can make his own choices about his campaign, \nbut be aware that any happenings which introduce the \nNecrons as a tangible enemy force earlier deviates from \nthe official Warhammer 40,000 timeline.\n78\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nThe City \nBeneath the \nSea\nSometimes at night the sea grants me glimpses of what lies beneath. \nOften I see not what is, but what was and what might be, for the \nocean is more ancient than the mountains. \n–from the writings of an ancient Terran Prophet\nU\nnless one of the Battle-Brothers is trained in piloting a \nsubmersible, the Kal’tran Bulwark provides Lieutenant \nHelmsman Shayde Athenos to command the vessel. \nThe young, slightly plump junior officer apologetically \nexplains that using the augury-only guidance systems of \nsubmersibles requires special training. All the Captains who \ncan do so are presently deployed. She resolutely promises to \ndeliver the Kill-team to their destination safely.\nThe cramped submersible was not built to accommodate \nSpace Marines, and they must hunch awkwardly to fit in most \nspaces of the ship. Perhaps one of them could loom in the \nbridge, but Athenos encourages them to wait in the starboard \nhold. Be certain to decide where everyone is located in the \nsubmersible and where the sigil is, as this plays an important \nrole later on. In particular, the GM should decide if any \nadditional NPCs are seated in the hold with the Battle-\nBrothers. This could create some interesting situations.\nEven the reinforced hull of the Cathurian groans as the Kill-\nteam descends into Sinner’s Trench. Only the densest alloys \ncan hold up the pressure at these depths, so the claustrophobic \nsubmersible has no viewports. It runs on the perceptions of \nthe machine spirits alone. For hours the occupants experience \nan endless feeling of sinking. The waters grow more and \nmore turbulent as they approach their destination. Towards \nthe end of the journey, a powerful shockwave suddenly rocks \nthe vessel, and it turns pitch black as every powered machine \ngoes out, including power armour and the Cathurian itself. \nPause and let the characters react, before informing them \na minute later when the machines start to wake. If anyone \nmakes an inquiry to the bridge, Athenos gives a reply laced \nwith colourful expletives indicating she doesn’t know what it \nwas. A constant rumbling vibration now pulses through the \nhull. They continue on for another thirty minutes. \nThen read aloud or paraphrase the following.\nThe sense of movement slows as you near the coordinates. \nSuddenly the Cathurian shudders violently; your ears fill with \nthe terrible sound of impact and buckling metal. Alarm klaxons \nbegin to blare. The voice of Lieutenant Helmsman Athenos comes \nover the proclaimer. “It’s all right! We’re not breached. I don’t \nunderstand. The augurs don’t show anything here... Oh for the \nShining Saint’s sake would someone turn off that noise?” The \nproclaimer cuts off.\nThe Battle-Brothers have reached their destination. The \nsigil begins to emit a bright green light, which illuminates the \nseams of anything that might contain it. On the other hand, if \nsomeone is actively holding it, they barely have time to notice \nthe light. The instant a living being makes contact with the \nsigil, everyone in the room displaces with a sensation very \nsimilar to teleportation deployment. \nno way out\nBy all appearances, when the Kill-team first arrives in the tomb city, they have no way to leave. Of course it wouldn’t \nbe a very enjoyable adventure if the characters were forced into a situation with no way out but death. Your players \nprobably have a sense that you wouldn’t be this unfair, but that doesn’t mean the characters are in on the secret. There \nare great roleplaying opportunities in the Kill-team believing that they face certain death here in the alien structure. You \ncan encourage those opportunities by highlighting how grim their situation looks.\n79\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nRead aloud or paraphrase the following:\nOne second you were bathed in the green light, and the next you \nstand in the centre of an alien city. Towering obelisks of gold-\netched marble intersect shapes of smooth curves and Euclidian \nangles—all revealed in their own virid illumination. At first the \nsky and the horizon are shimmering black, but then you see a long \ncylinder floating above you: the Cathurian. You are in the fabled \nsunken city, and a huge dome of force surrounds it, holding back \nthe press of the lightless waters. That is what the ship struck, and \nwhere the sigil has taken you.\nWhoever touched the sigil finds it in their hand or near \ntheir feet as they get their bearings. The Battle-Brothers (and \nany unfortunate guests) stand in a square depression amidst \nthe xenos structures. Emerald light is fading from the border \nof lines and symbols as the mysterious transport mechanism \npowers down. The force dome appears to be emanating from \nan elevated crystal far in the distance. Anyone with an auspex \nor similar sensors detects huge amounts of energy flowing \nthrough the radiant green polyhedron.\nAhead, giant doors stand parted. They are as tall as drawings \ndepict the entrance to the Golden Throne. Beyond them, the \nmonolithic tomb awaits.\nTHE ALIEN TOMB cITY\nThe city beneath the sea is not a ruin. It is a great tomb, \nand however wrong about these aliens the Reborn cult may \nhave been, they were right about thing: this ancient race is \nimmortal. They do not rot here; they only wait to re-awaken. \nThe Traitor Legions behind the entire scheme intend to see \nthat happen. While their primary objective may be retrieving \nthe technology sample for Dahzak’s cabal, they are not about \nto pass up the opportunity to strike at the Achilus Crusade. \nKarlack is the very lynchpin of the Iron Collar, and if such a \npowerful enemy were to assault the planet from within, the \nCrusade might never recover.\nThe complex where the action takes place is only one \nsmall fragment of the huge tomb city, but it is still massive. \nThe smallest corridors are wide enough to fit two Rhinos \nabreast; the stone chambers are tall enough to hold a Titan. \nWithin these xenos crypts, Lamdus Rize learns the peril of \nattempting to deceive a seer. Dahzak had divined that the \nAlpha Legion would betray him, and gave Sethahar orders \nto strike pre-emptively. Once they had obtained a vector \namplifier and begun opening the tombs, Rize’s use to the \ncabal was at an end. \nThe Chaos Space Marines detect the Battle-Brothers’ \narrival. Sethahar allows Rize to deploy his men to buy more \ntime. However, as Sethahar and Lamdus reach the departure \ncircle, it becomes clear that the sorcerer has no intention of \nwaiting for the Alpha Legion before leaving. The two Chaos \nSpace Marines turn on one another on the far side of the \nMonolith field. While this action takes place “off screen,” the \nKill-team’s new Primary Objective should be obvious: stop \nthe aliens from waking. However, the sunken city also offers \nopportunities to learn more about their enemies and their real \ngoals (see page 141 for a map of this region).\nentranCe\nThe Battle-Brothers immediately notice the sluggishness of \ntheir armour and the heaviness of their limbs as they enter the \nradius of the vitality absorption. Beyond the entry corridor \nare two overlapping pyramidal chambers, extending so \nhigh that their apex is scarcely visible from within. Intact \nsarcophagi scale these mountainous walls, thousands upon \nthousands built into the incline. The Kill-team also finds the \nrecently shattered remains of a bizarre spider-like creature \nand its apparent victims on the smooth floor. \nleft Behind\nWhat if one of the player characters wasn’t in the \nhold when the sigil activated? The Cathurian has a \nsingle nautical boarding torpedo, built from the same \npressure-tolerant metal as the submersible itself. This is \nhow Athenos had been originally expecting to deploy \nher passengers. If anyone was left behind, they can load \ninto the boarding torpedo while the Enginseers adjust \nits electromagnetic properties. They target what appears \nto be an unstable portion of the dome, theorizing the \naltered field may allow the torpedo to pass through. \nThen they fire the Battle-Brother(s), and pray.\niMplaCaBle hunger\nThe energy drain the Kill-team experienced earlier \non the sub was the activation of the tomb’s primary \nsystems—the call for its occupants to wake. This process \nrequired great amounts of energy, and the alien xenos \ncity is capable of harvesting that from anywhere. Most \nof that energy came from the life forces of the Reborn \nxeno-cultists. However, the mechanism continues to \nslowly leech life from every source available to it—\nflesh and machine alike. As long as the absorption field \nremains active it has the following effects:\n•Vitality Leech: Anyone inside the tomb complex \ncarries one level of Fatigue. Note that this affects \nxeno-cultists and Chaos Space Marines as well.\n•Power Drain: Any device that uses a power source \nbehaves as though under the Minor Disruption \neffect of a Haywire Field. See the table on page \n143 of the Deathwatch Rulebook.\nThe GM may also wish to embellish with \ninopportune equipment failures on either side at \nrandom intervals. Note that the alien technology and \nconstructs are not affected.\n80\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nRead aloud or paraphrase the following: \nThe metal carcass of a large construct is strewn across the \nchamber. You count several jointed limbs—the length of each \nclose to your entire height—and at least one weapon arm. It is \nprimarily pitted with bolter fire, but some portions of the creature \nbear the scars of a power weapon. One of the severed limbs is \ngnarled and misshapen, as though crafted to mimic the deformity \nof mutation. Several dead xeno-cultists also lie in the chamber, \ntheir bodies shorn to pieces and riddled with singed openings \nTheir lips are frozen in screams of horror.\nAn Ordinary (+10) Scrutiny Test observes that \nboth the bolter shells and the wounds made by them are   \nAdeptus Astartes calibre. \nalpha legion aSSault\nThe next triangular chamber has several square openings \nleading into a hallway behind it. The Kill-team has little \nchance to look around, as they are immediately assaulted \nby Alpha Legion Chaos Space Marines. At this point the \nAlpha Legion’s goal is to kill or at least delay the Kill-team \nuntil Lamdus and Sethahar can complete their own primary \nobjective: retrieval of a vector amplifier. However, even as this \ncombat takes place, Sethahar is enacting his betrayal. \n If any of the Alpha Legion Chaos Space Marines survive \n(either because they withdraw or were not present) they \nreturn to harry the Kill-team once they discover that they \nhave been left behind. They realise that they are now trapped \nin the tomb with the rising xenos, and know that the Adeptus \nAstartes must have a sigil of their own in order to have \nentered. Their goal on subsequent attacks—which can occur \nanywhere in the complex— is to take the sigil key. (This can \nbe a good way to draw your players’ attention to one means \nof their own escape if they don’t figure it out.) \nIn any situation where the Kill-team has the opportunity \nto observe Alpha Legion corpses (such as after battle with \nthem) have each character make a Difficult (–10) Scrutiny \nTest. On a success they observe a thin layer of a foul-smelling \nochre powder coating their enemy’s armour. A Difficult (–10) \nLore: Scholastic (Chymistry) or Very Hard (–20) Chem-\nUse Test identifies the substance by smell and appearance. \nThe powder is trialkaline. This substance is a powerful \nanti-corrosive often used in toxic environments. It can also \nbe analyzed in a safer setting using the proper equipment, \nwhich requires only a Routine (+20) Lore: Scholastic \n(Chymistry) Test.\nIf anyone attempts to follow the trail of the other agents \nof Chaos and the xeno-cultists, it requires a Challenging \n(+0) Tracking Test to locate the miniscule patches of rubble \nand blood left by their passing. Their course leads down the \nnortheast passage of this hallway.\nControl deviCe\nLike all of these aliens’ technological remnants, this smooth, \nangular mechanism has little in common with the gothic, \nornamented machines of the Imperium. The device orchestrates \nthe energies of the tomb city, including the waking and stasis \nof its occupants. Whatever omen or stimulus it may have \ninitially awaited, Sethahar’s spell— channelling the life force of \nhundreds of xeno-cultists—triggered it early. A pulsing green \ncrystal tops the pyramidal control structure, which itself sits \non a vast cylindrical platform open to the black sea-sky. Gold \nwalkways connect the platform to two other identical circular \nislands. Corpses heap across one another on these islands.\nThe gold bridges are flat and only a few centimetres thick, \nbut solid as adamantite. However, an eight metre gap has \nbeen melted from each walkway with a high-powered energy \nweapon, trapping the Reborn xeno-cultists on the stone pillars \nwhere they died. They bear no visible wounds, but their skin \nis pale and ashy. If anyone examines them, the bodies are ice \ncold to the touch.\nThe control device is too foreign to consider operating. Its \ndark, shimmering surface bears no visible interface. The crystal \ncontinues to throb slowly, like the beating of a sinister heart. \nIt is incredibly resilient but not unbreakable, possessing AP \n20 (but only one wound). If any of the Battle-Brothers decide \nto shatter it, the absorption field effects end. However, power \ncontinues to hum through the tomb, and the low rumbling \npersists as ancient seals continue to deteriorate. It is too late to \nstop the creatures from waking.\nStarSCape alCove\nThis alcove is covered with carvings. However, before the Battle-\nBrothers can examine them closely, they have xeno-cultists to deal \nwith. A handful of the Reborn fled the Chaos Space Marines and \nalien construction rather than be herded onto the pillars. While \nthey came to their senses in time to avoid becoming sacrifices to \nthe awakening, they are still trapped in the tomb city. Roughly a \ndozen people huddle together beneath the alien carvings. They \ngasp at the first heavy tread of a Space Marine boot, but their fear \nturns to relief when they see the symbols of the Inquisition and \nloyal Adeptus Astartes Chapters. They erupt into a cacophony of \npleas for salvation and forgiveness.\nIf the Kill-team does look closer at the depictions on the \nwalls, they are part navigational and part worship. Similar \nto the reliefs at the Cenotaph but far more elaborate, these \nwithin the toMBS\nThe interior of the Necropolis feels more like a \nxenos world than a location on an Imperial Fortress \nplanet. The GM can help maintain this alien feel by \ndrawing attention throughout the tombs to some of \nthe following environmental aspects:\n•In many places the stone of the tombs is so smooth \nis seems like metal. Sometimes it is cold to the \ntouch, and others strangely warm.\n•Brilliant green energy crystals and green \nillumination\n•Strange geometry in all of the structure’s angles \nand ordered xenos runes\n81\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\ndesigns track the movement of the galaxy’s eastern fringe. \nGlittering gold lines weave among the stars and nebula; these \nunlabelled courses seem like the focus of the pieces more than \nthe stars themselves. Correlating any of the objects on the \nwall to the Jericho Reach is only possible with the encryption \nkey, and even then it is not easy. The chart depicts many \ndead stars and planetary bodies that no longer exist, and \nlacks many that have been born since its creation. Gleaning \nmeaningful information from the charts on the spot requires \na Challenging (+0) Navigation (Stellar) or Scholastic \nLore (Astromancy) Test. However, it is possible to capture \npicts of the relief and compare them to standard charts later. \nFindings might include:\n•When this map was etched, the Hadex Anomaly did \nnot exist. Instead, at that location the chart shows the \nill-fated systems that became the Charon Stars. No sign \nexists of what might have caused the terrible wound in \nreality that would one day drag them into the warp and \ntheir damnation.\n•The area now dubbed the Well of Night is surrounded \nby geometric symbols that not even the cipher   \ncan elucidate.\n•The region where the Black Reef sits is completely void, \nas though unexplored and uncharted.\n•Nearly all the celestial bodies show some discrepancy \nin their nature or location given the countless aeons that \nhave passed since the chart’s carving. Except the Erioch \nsystem, which is shown exactly where it hides today, \naccompanied by mathematical notation showing seven \nidentical planets.\nidol rooM\nThis alcove mirrors the position of the other. It does not \ncontain carvings, but statues. Auspexes refuse to penetrate \nthe shimmering metal, but the sculptures produce a hollow \necho if struck. Each slender figure is vaguely humanoid, but \ntheir features and visages vary widely. Their faces are without \nexception cold—either mocking or hungry or both. The few \nthat bear weapons carry nothing similar to the technology \nfound with the Reborn. These representations almost seem to \nbe the gods’ gods.\na ruined portal\nThe various structures of the massive tomb city connect via \na series of portals. When power returned to the tomb, the \ndormant stacks of metal blocks once again framed gateways of \nswirling emerald light. This is what the Chaos Space Marines \nhad been waiting for. They sundered the closest portal and \nstripped it of its vector amplifier. If the Kill-team encounters \nthe portal’s remains, it lies in a heap of polyhedral shapes \nwith the last flickers of energy quickly fading from it.\nthe Monolith field\nThe northern wall of the ringed hall holds one of the complex’s \nfew openings. A long portion of the wall has been cut away, \nforming a window. This window looks directly onto a field \nof glowing pyramids floating above a dark, sheer surface. \nEach monolithic ziggurat holds a large green crystal at its \napex, and it crackles with arcs of energy. It is difficult to grasp \nthe exact size of these edifices from within the tombs, as the \nmassive complex renders even the largest objects insignificant \nin comparison to its own scale.\nA long tower of steps leads from a nearby hall spoke down into \nthe field. The trail of the remaining Chaos Space Marines takes \nthis exit out into the expanse of hovering pyramids. Only then \ndoes their size take on meaning. These are not more buildings, \nbut weapon platforms. Each of their four corners mounts an array \nof huge energy weapons. These beam weapons look identical in \nall but size to the alien rifles in the hands of the senior reborn. \nIf their strength increased as much as their size, these weapons \ncould be capable of stripping the hull from a Rhino. \nThe smooth pyramids hover motionless. However, their \ninert appearance is deceptive. It is impossible to say whether \nthe structures trigger on proximity or if their machine spirits \npossess some malicious awareness, but if any Battle-Brothers \nattempt to cross the field, the monoliths erupt with deadly beams \nof destructive energy. Anyone wishing to cross the long field \nmust apply diligence to avoid being flayed alive. He can make a \nseries of Dodge Tests to avoid being hit or Concealment Tests \nto avoid being detected. (The GM should determine the exact \nnumber and difficulty of these Tests depending on the level of \nthe characters. See page 66 for the Damage taken on a hit from \nthe lightning arc projectors.)\nThe far side of the field holds two points of interest. One \nis the arcane transport device that can be used to leave the \nnecropolis. The other is a magnificent view of the energy crystal \nprojecting the force dome around the Necropolis. It floats with \ntwo bordering platforms hundreds of feet in the air. An opening \nappears to lead out to this area from elsewhere in the tomb, \nbut there is no ground connection from the monolith field. For \nmore information on the transport circle and the energy core, \nsee below.\ntranSport CirCle\nThe Undying were masters of space and time. Teleportation \nwas a common method of travel for them, as witnessed in \nthe sigils. Naturally, the devices are not one way. At the edge \nof the monolith field is a large ring inscribed with gold \ncircuitry. An Ordinary (+10) Scrutiny Test recognises it \nas virtually identical to the one in the empty mausoleum \nbeneath the Cenotaph. Its centre contains a vertical slot that \nis conspicuously the size and shape of the sigil key. By the \ntime any pursuers reach this point, Sethahar has gone. The \nsurrounding warp still echoes with the taint of his sorcery. \nHowever, Lamdus remains. The Battle-Brothers cannot miss \nthe Space Marine in Alpha Legion power armour who leans \nup against a fractured pillar. He still lives, barely. His helmet \nis gone, his armour scorched by fire and rent as though by \nblades. His eyes come to focus on the Kill-team, and he clears \n82\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nthe blood from his lungs before speaking. Lamdus is unarmed \nand slow moving. Assuming they do not kill him before he \ncan speak, read aloud or paraphrase the following: \nThe Chaos Space Marine’s lips twist into a self-deprecating \nsmirk. “It took you long enough to get here,” he rasps. “I was \nbeginning to think my vengeance would have to die with me.” \nThe bent heraldry on his armour and the number of blackened \ntrophies that remain suggest this man was an important member \nof his Legion. “Listen closely, loyal sons.” He savours the last \ntwo words in bitter amusement. “There is more at stake here than \neven this world. On Samech- on Samech Dahzak schemes. Our \npurpose in it no longer matters. He beat us to betrayal. So...better \nyour victory than his.”\nRize may have breath left to whisper short answers to one \nor two questions; if anyone asks about Inquisitor Vincent, Rize \nbelieves he perished at sea with the rest of his men. The Chaos \nSpace Marine leaves them with one last enigmatic warning:\n“Do not let Dahzak foresee your intentions as he did mine. Only \nthe- the Emperor protects.” He does not draw another breath. \nRize is content to die if the Kill-team leaves him to do \nso. His iron will resists any attempts to revive him; he has no \ndesire to be a prisoner of his enemies. \nKnow Thine Enemy\nThe Alpha Legion is too secretive for the names of their \nleaders to circulate, but many other Chaos Space Marines \ncovet infamy. Dahzak is one of those. A Difficult (–10) \nForbidden Lore (The Traitor Legions) Test recognises \nthe sorcerer’s name. The Degrees of Success determine how \nmuch a Battle-Brother knows about him (see Table 2–3 on \npage 84).\nthe writhing Corridor\nWhen the Kill-team enters this long corridor, have each \nmember make an Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test. Those \nwho succeed perceive movement on the ceiling high above \nthem. From where they stand the entire dark plane above \nseems to ripple like a shadowy ocean. Anyone capable \nof magnification or some form of closer inspection sees \nswarming beetle-like constructs made from the same metal as \nthe arachnid remains at the necropolis’s entrance.\nthe weStern paSSage\nThis dark corridor ends in a wall of collapsed stone; the \ntombs have not perfectly survived the years and the seismic \nactivity of their own opening. The passage leads deeper into \nthe necropolis, but it would take some time to move the fallen \nstone. An Easy (+30) Tracking Test confirms that nothing \ntangible has passed this way in centuries.\n83\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nMatrix anteChaMBer\nTwo open doorways lead from either side of this perpendicular \nroom into the power matrix. As the Kill-team nears this \njuncture, read aloud or paraphrase the following:\nYou no longer need to suppose what the construct at the entrance \nlooked like intact. One undamaged and in possession of all eight \nlimbs hovers through one of the wide entrances in eerie silence. \nHad it been forged by Imperial hands, such an advanced creation \nwould surely be adorned with embellishments and litanies. \nInstead, its angular shell reflects only functional considerations. \nIts massive body is unpainted metal; the only colour it carries \nare several glowing green photo-receptors on its small head. One \nof its forward limbs is a wicked trident of claws. The other is \na long, sinister energy weapon. The emerald eyes momentarily \nbrighten as it fixates on you.\nThis automaton has crawled the tombs for millennia \nuncounted, maintaining the sanctuary of its masters until \ntheir return. The tomb guardian is a mighty enemy, primarily \nlashing out with its bladed claws, and only using the particle \nemitter on foes at range or who are exceptionally armoured. \nIt knows only devotion to its masters and has no sense of self \npreservation. It relentlessly attacks these intruders until they \nor it are destroyed. If the GM wants to increase the challenge \nof the last encounter, he may wish to imply that time is up \non the Objective. In that scenario, if the Battle-Brothers don’t \nsplit their attention between destroying the power matrix \nand fending off the tomb guardian, all is lost. Note that \nthe guardian causes Fear; see page 277 of the Deathwatch \nRulebook for how Fear affects Space Marines.\nneCropoliS power Matrix\nThe tombs’ power core is a room of suspended platforms and \narcing electricity. Each of the antechamber doors leads out to \na floating disc, across from which a perpendicular network \nof three more discs hovers completely unsupported. The \nsixth circle hangs in the centre, with a flashing green crystal \nhundreds of times bigger than that on the control device, or \neven the monoliths. It flashes ever brighter as the tremors \ngrow in intensity. If the Battle-Brothers find a way to the \npower matrix through a different route than the antechamber \n(such as through the monolith field), the tomb guardian \nattacks there instead. \nA virtually impenetrable force dome similar to that covering \nthe sunken city protects the power matrix. (It counts as a force \nfield with a protection rating of 95 and no Overload possible.) \nHowever, this is only detected if the Kill-team studies the \ncrystal carefully before launching an attack on the power \nmatrix. The first time anyone attempts to damage the crystal \nin any way, the core’s defence mechanisms activate. This has \ntwo primary effects: first, the core’s defence batteries power \nup. In every subsequent Round, it fires the equivalent of a \nParticle Emitter beam at every character in the room, using a \nBallistic Skill of 40. Secondly, it calls the monoliths on the \nfield, which begin to drift towards the elevated platform. \nwaking anCientS\nThe Battle-Brothers’ Objective to keep the slumbering \nxenos from waking is a race a against a ticking clock—a \nclock whose hands they can’t see. Even without an \nobjective timer on the last part of this Mission, it is \nimportant to create a sense of urgency and escalating \nthreat. The move from the still tombs at the entry way \nto the writhing tombs beyond is one way to do this. \nOthers include the tremors growing louder, and the \nmonolith power crystals beginning to light.\nIf the GM feels that the players have tarried too \nlong, he may want to consider having a small wave \nof occupants actually rise. This will drive home how \nimminent the xenos’ waking is. The profile for spectral \nharbingers has been included in the appendix. Since \nthey can become incorporeal, these wraiths would be \nthe first to exit their sarcophagi. Furthermore, their \nghostlike appearance means they seem more like spirits \nof the dead than a race of living metal aliens, thus \nkeeping the Warhammer 40,000 continuity intact.\nTable 2–3 Dahzak’s Infamy\nDegrees of SuccessDetails Known\nStandard Success\nDahzak is a powerful Chaos Space Marine sorcerer known to be operating in the corrupt worlds of the \nCharon Stars. He is an exiled member of the Thousand Sons Traitor Legion\nOne\nThe stories of Dahzak’s past exploits in the Jericho Reach often place him at battles for troves of tainted \ntomes and talismans. Among the Thousand Sons there exists a splinter cabal led by the exile Ahriman. It \nis rumoured this faction was responsible for turning the majority of the Thousands Sons Legion into the \nRubric Marines. Dahzak is or was a member of this cabal.\nTwo\nDahzak is a powerful diviner, and owes much of his status to his ability to predict the moves of his enemies. \nWhile his innate talents seem to lie in foresight, it is said he constantly seeks and acquires spells and items \nrelated to direct interaction and movement through the warp. \nThree (or more)\nDahzak fell strangely silent shortly after the arrival of the Achilus Crusade. While the optimistic like to \nboast that he was slain in the initial clashes of the Acheros Salient, dark whispers from the Hadex Anomaly \nsay that he has spent those long years forging an alliance with other corrupt powers of the Charon Stars to \nenact some terrible plan.\n84\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nThe Battle-Brothers are now in double jeopardy of running \nout of time. The aliens are close to waking, and even if the \nKill-team avoids the arcing energy, they stand a slim chance \nof survival once the monoliths get into range. They need to \ndevise some method of shutting down the core, and quickly! \nIf the players continue to repeatedly Attack the power matrix \nwith their usual methods, the GM should drop a hint that a \ndirect assault might not be the best approach. For example: \n“Once again your plasma blast spatters harmlessly on the deflection \nbarrier. Nothing you have done seems to have scratched the device. You’re \nbeginning to think you might need another way to shut it down.”\nIdeally the Kill-team comes up with a plan that uses their \nindividual abilities to overcome this challenge. The easiest way \nto represent it is with the Assistance rules on page 204 of the \nDeathwatch Rulebook. For this task, ignore the limit on the \nnumber of characters that can assist, but set a Difficulty that \nis at least Very Hard (–30) for the base Test. Based on their \nplan, decide which action (and therefore whose Test) will be \nthe main Test. Then allow each assisting character to describe \nwhat aid they are giving, using either a Trained Skill, Talent, \nSpecial Ability, Psychic Power, Squad/Solo Mode Ability, or a \npiece of equipment. Possible examples include:\n•Using Demolitions to create a super-penetrating blast \nwith linked krak grenades.\n•Use of the Divination discipline to determine the best \ntiming and angle for overcoming the force field.\n•Applying Tech-Use or Ferric Lure to disrupt the gravitic \nsuspension system of the core and de-stabilise the matrix\n•Using a Signum to coordinate fire.\nIf the Kill-team fails an attempt, it means that a particular \napproach does not work and they must try an alternate plan \n(by at a minimum choosing a new character or Test for the \nmain Test). Additionally, each failure means another volley of \nenergy from the defence systems, and time for the monoliths \nto draw closer. \nTHE cRASHING TIDE\nThe power matrix is all that is holding back the crushing \nocean above. If the Battle-Brothers succeed in destroying \nthe power matrix or otherwise de-activating the tombs, read \naloud or paraphrase the following:\nThe green light of the power matrix goes out. For a moment, \nthere is utter silence. Then the black sky collapses into a torrent \nof falling water.\nIf they are outside at the power core, the Battle-Brothers \nmust get inside and quickly to avoid being swept away as the \nocean crashes down on the necropolis. The impact of millions \nof tons of water creates fractures immediately. Large stone \nchunks fracture from the tombs as they begin to fill with \nwater. If the Battle-Brothers have pieced together how to use \nthe sigil to depart the tombs, they battle rising water and the \ncollapsing structure to make it back to the transport circle\nIf they don’t use the circle, other possibilities for their \nsurvival include:\n•If the boarding torpedo was launched, it can survive \neven the pressure of the crashing waters. The Battle-\nBrothers could shelter inside it and vox to the Cathurian   \nfor retrieval.\n•Abuse the Battle-Brothers with a Round or two of \ncrushing Damage and Fatigue as their armour buckles \nand begins to implode. At the last moment, the Cathurian \ngrapples them with an electromagnet and pulls them \ninside before they perish.\nWhen Lieutenant Helmsman Athenos sees the Kill-team, \nread or paraphrase the following:\n“You’re alive! Well, thank the Shining Saint.” She has no time to \nsay anything else as the Cathurian spins violently. You can feel \nthe ship buffeted and pulled by the whirlpool and debris of the \ncollapsing necropolis. The metal hull strains and the submersible’s \nengines roar as it tries to counteract the pull. With a sudden \nforward lunge, you feel the vessel pull free of the suction. The \nCathurian’s engines bang and rattle like a shoddy bionic lung, \nbut you are on your way back to the surface.\nThe Battle-Brothers have a few hours to get their bearings, \ntreat their injuries, and discuss what just happened before \nthe Cathurian limps back to dock at Kal’tran. Oddly, any \ntechnology the Battle-Brothers may have taken off the \nReborn xeno-cultists has vanished without a trace. However, \nthe sigil key remains.\n85\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nTable 2–4: Mission Experience Rewards\nObjectiveExperience Awarded\nSave Inquisitor Quist’s Life350 XP\nComplete Inquisitor Vincent’s investigation and determine what lies beneath the southern ocean350 XP\nPrevent the Reborn from rising and consuming Karlack400 XP\nDiscover the fate of Inquisitor Vincent175 XP\nKill or capture Isiaah Faln250 XP\nGet past the Alpha Legion forces in the tomb city250 XP\nDetermine the city’s exact location200 XP\nFind a way to enter the tomb city175 XP\nAcquire transport capable of operating in extreme ocean depths200 XP\nPrevent the Sons of Taeg from assassinating Prince-Prefect Allewis150 XP\nHelp Mediator Dyne deal with Alexei Drahj100 XP\nDefeat the xeno-cult beneath the Cenotaph75 XP\nArTEfACT MAnIfEST\nCrescent Bladed Sceptre\nTo the best of my observations this short staff is purely ceremonial. It is \ntopped by two large crescent blades and two smaller sets of blades, \nall symmetrical. It does appear to have some form of micro-circuitry \nembedded in the handle, but it is of insufficient magnitude to possibly \nconstitute a weapon. It does appear that the bottom part of the \nsceptre has broken off. \nCrystal Conduit\nI have personally collected three samples of these translucent \ntubes in varying sizes, and they are perhaps the most commonly \nfound xenos artefact on Karlack, aside from the rock fashioned into \nso-called “eternity charms.” I shudder to think how many of these \nrelics are probably in use as doorstops and even glassware by \nthe natives. The conduits have proved highly resistant to heat and \nenergy, suggesting they were used to conduct power in weapons \nand technology.\nfield Emitter\nThis small device bears a passing resemblance to force fields and similar Imperial devices, leading \nboth Dyne and myself to speculate that it likewise emitted some kind of field. However, it is entirely \npossible that the artefact serves no such purpose. It could be an explosive, a beacon, or perhaps even \njust a lifeless religious icon for all the response we have been able to prompt from it.\nMetal Carapace\nThis curious metal shell is at once smooth and angular. Less than a metre long, it appears as though \nsome sort of appendages once connected to both sides of the shell. Its underside displays remnants \nof gravitational projectors.\nBroken halberd\nThere is very little left of this weapon. The composition of its handle is similar to the sceptre, although \nthe circuitry is less complex. Its weighting and broken joints suggest some form of double-bladed \nmelee weapon.\nBy THE AuTHorITy of InQuISITor ZAEr VInCEnT, orDo XEnoS\n86\n\nII\n:\n A Stony Sleep\nEscape by Teleportation\nIf the Battle-Brothers use the sigil, they find themselves \nbeneath the Cenotaph of Achilus, at the matching circle in \nthe Empty Mausoleum.\nreturn to Citadel priMariS\nQuist is awake and recovering when the Kill-team returns to \nCitadel Primaris. She listens intently to whatever report they \ngive. If they retrieved Inquisitor Vincent, she asks that he be \nbrought to her. The broken man weeps quietly against her \nshoulder and she speaks gentle words of comfort to him. All \nthe while, her left hand drifts beneath her robes. It emerges \nwith her bolt pistol. In one swift motion, she brings it to the \nback of his head and pulls the trigger. The explosion spatters \nher in his blood. Mediator Dyne stiffens, as though about \nto retaliate for the death of his master, but Nihl’s presence is \nenough to make him think better of it. If the Space Marines \nhave grown attached to Vincent or the GM has some other \nreason to believe they might want to interfere in this matter, \nhe may want to allow an Agility Test to intervene before \nQuist pulls the trigger.\nOn the other hand, if the Kill-team reports his existence \nbut left him elsewhere, she verifies his location and gives a \nsmall nod to Nihl, who silently departs to dispatch him. If the \nBattle-Brothers do not make an issue of the execution, then \nQuist has nothing more to say on the matter. However, if they \nquestion her at the Citadel or on the return trip to Erioch, she \nsays simply:\n“The Zaer Vincent I knew was a good man. He devoted his life to \nprotecting mankind even in the Reach where many of the faithless \nhave forgotten the Emperor. The person I killed was a broken \ntraitor. He gave aid to the enemies of man and rambled about \nxenos ruins to anyone he saw. He was a liability to the Ordo, \nand it would show no pity for his failing. The clean death I gave \nhim was a mercy.”\nQuist’s preference is that everyone believes Vincent died \nwith his retinue—not to hide the execution but to preserve \nhis integrity. She requests that they let her be the one to \nreport on him, but does not argue if the Battle-Brothers take \nother actions. She may, however, hint that she will omit being \npoisoned from her report (assuming it happened) if they agree \nto her request. \nreSpeCtS for the dead\nThe Battle-Brothers most likely bring news of at least one \nInquisitor’s death after this Mission. The Inquisitor of the \nChamber, Hezika Carmillus, arranges a funerary ceremony \nshortly after the Kill-team’s return. The following assumes \nQuist lived; if she perished Inquisitor Carmillus takes her place \nin presiding over the rites. The Battle-Brothers are given the \noption to attend. Read aloud or paraphrase the following:\nThe funeral takes place in one of many unused chambers along \nWatch Fortress Erioch’s exterior. Death has finally given it a \npurpose. Had the ceremony been somewhere other than a remote \nwar front, it might have been a grand political affair. Instead, the \nattendees number a few dozen, mainly the resident Ordo Xenos \nmembers and Battle-Brothers like yourself. Watch Commander \nMordigael and several others give short eulogies.\nThe Battle-Brothers may also elect one of their number to \nspeak, if they so desire. As the ranking member of the Ordo \nXenos, Inquisitor Carmillus speaks last:\n“None of us can ask for more than to die in service to the \nImperium. The number of people who hear our name or speak \npraises over our coffin does not change who we were in life, \nwhere we succeeded and where we failed. A cold grave is reward \nenough; for it is the only rest the vigilant will ever know. So go \nnow to the slumber you have earned.” She gives the signal for the \ncasket to be released into the void.\nrewardS\nTable 2–4 Mission Experience Rewards (see page 86) shows \nthe value of completing each of the Objectives if you award \nexperience using the detailed mission-based method. \nThe following are worth 1 Renown each:\n•Preventing Inquisitor Quist from being poisoned or \nif she chooses to omit it from her logs.\n•Stopping the Reborn xenos from rising again.\n•Defeating the Alpha Legion.\n•Killing or capturing Isiaah Faln.\n•Any two of the following: stop Alexei Drahj, bring \nInquisitor Vincent to Quist, stop the sons of Taeg from \nkilling the Prince-Prefect.\n•If the Battle-Brothers deliberately killed any Imperial \ncitizens other than cultists, they lose 1 Renown.\nThe GM should reference page 270 in the Deathwatch\nRulebook to see if the Kill-team qualifies for additional \nRenown for completing multiple Objectives. As always, \nhe should also feel free to further reward clever plans and   \ngood roleplaying. \nfuture MiSSionS\nThe starscape in the submerged temple might have raised or \nanswered any number of questions. The GM could easily add \none or half a dozen sites marked upon it that the Deathwatch \nmust now examine. One can only hope that all traces of \nthe tomb city were crushed by the sea. However, Karlack’s \nsouthern oceans are infamous for washing strange objects up \nto shore. Even as the Battle-Brothers return home, inhabitants \nof the archipelagos might be hauling a shimmering metal idol \nout of the sea.\n87\n\nII \n:\n A Stony Sleep\nAppendix: NPCs\nprinCe-prefeCt allewiS\nFor more information on Allewis see page 59.\nPrince-Prefect Allewis Profile\nwS BS S T Ag Int Per wP Fel\n46 34 33 41 35 50 52 45 44\nMovement: 3/6/9/18  Wounds: 16\nSkills: Awareness (Per) +10, Carouse (T), Charm (Fel) +10, \nCommand (Fel) +10, Deceive (Fel) +20, Dodge (Ag) +10, \nLiteracy (Int), Scholastic Lore (Heraldry), Scrutiny (Per) +10.\nTalents: Master Orator, Melee Weapon Training (Primitive). \nPistol Weapon Training (Las).\nArmour: None.\nWeapons: Monoblade (1d10+3 R, Pen 2, Balanced), \nDuelling Laspistol (30m; S/–/–; 1d10+3 E; Pen 7; Clip 1; \nRld 1 Full, Accurate, Tearing). \nGear: Extremely fine and expensive clothing, ornate and \nostentatious jewellery, 2 spare charges for duelling laspistol. \nalexei drahj\nThis rich merchant is secretly a member of the Transpired \nCircle.

Sometimes you \ngive a man a shield and show him how to stand true. However, it is \nthe Adeptus Astartes’ duty to protect mankind by taking the sword to \nthat which man cannot stand against.”\n–Vulkan He’stan of the Salamanders Chapter\nD\nahzak and the Vinculum Proselytes finally have \neverything they need to complete their attack on the \nwarp gate. At the eleventh hour, the Battle-Brothers \nrealise how great a menace stirs on Samech. To protect all of \nthe Jericho Reach, they launch a pre-emptive strike into the \nheart of the Chaos-held Acheros Salient.\nOVERVIEw\nThe Deathwatch eventually deciphers the meanings of their \nfindings on Karlack and Aurum, and realises that the unholy \nalliance on Samech is targeting the Warp Gate. The Battle-\nBrothers have an opportunity to champion their own theory \nand bring it before the Chamber of Vigilance. Once the threat \nis recognised, defences around the Iron Collar are bolstered. \nHowever there is little assurance that the Crusade can stop the \nassault. The Kill-team is charged with entering the corrupt \nmechanical heart of Samech and halting the scheme before \nit launches. \nThe renowned Thunder’s Word transports the Kill-team. \nOnce on Samech, the path to their Objectives is relatively \nevident, but without making some detours to garner additional \ninformation and allies, the chance of success is remote. The \nKill-team can choose between several potential groups to aid \nthem in destroying the warship Ruin Bringer and penetrating \nthe Irradial Forge where their enemies and the thaumagramm \ndiodes await.\nRUNNING THE VIGILANT \nSwORD\nThis Mission sends the Battle-Brothers into a hostile \nenvironment to accomplish an Objective of the utmost \nimportance. It’s the kind of high-stakes adventure that \nSpace Marines—and their players—live for. As one would \nexpect on a planet full of enemies, opportunities for combat \nare everywhere. The Kill-team encounters many injustices \nthat heroes may have a difficult time looking past, and the \nenvironment is especially offensive to Techmarines. If the \nplayers stop to battle every patrol and destroy every twisted \nmachine, you are in for a lot of fighting. If your group enjoys \nthat kind of game, no problem. However, those who don’t \nwant to spend the entire night rolling dice should remember \n(and help the players remember) that the Kill-team has a job \nto do—and it is not fighting in the streets. Ideally the group \nwants to balance a focus on the Primary Objective with doing \nsome “collateral good.” You should decide ahead of time \nwhich Optional Encounters you want to present to the Kill-\nteam as possible Tertiary Objectives so that you can bring \nthem to the team’s attention.\nThe Kill-team’s task is monumental. This adventure \nallows them to make certain choices or complete additional \nObjectives to make their Primary Objective easier. Stress the \ndifficulty of accomplishing their goal if they do not go out of \ntheir way to help others and gain allies. Few of the options \noffered to the Kill-team are savoury, but some are certainly \nlesser evils than others. If your group is unwilling to sacrifice \nanything— the slightest of their precepts or a single civilian \nlife—it is up to you whether they stand a reasonable chance \nof success.\nAnother factor that can help (or hinder) the Battle-Brothers \nis the choices they have made in the Missions leading up to \nthis one. In addition to the summary table of consequences \nbelow, each event where the consequence is relevant carries \nthe label Mission Consequence. This should help you easily \nspot them during the narrative.\nIf you want to use this Mission without building on \nthe previous two adventures in the Emperor Protects, the \nrealisations that lead to the Kill-team’s deployment can come \nentirely from the Deathwatch’s information network. You \nshould pick a balance of assets and obstacles to give the Kill-\nteam from Table 3–1: Mission Consequences (see pages 98-\n99). Rather than being the result of their actions, these events \nare just the beginning state of the Mission.\n96\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nFalse Conclusions\nIf your group prefers a story with more twists and turns, you \nmay want to begin the Mission on Erioch with a slightly \nincorrect idea of what Dahzak and the Vinculum Proselytes \nare planning. If the players champion their own theory—right \nor wrong—this should be the accepted assumption as long as \nit is remotely plausible. Otherwise, the Chamber of Vigilance \ndraws the conclusion that Dahzak and his allies in the Charon \nStars intend to use the thaumagramm diodes to power an \nundetectable warship. There are plenty of opportunities later \non Samech to reveal what is really going on.\nThe Pieces Fall \nInto Place\nFor days I had kept my eyes downcast, trying to deny the dark bloom \nabove. At last, I could deny its weight no longer; with hesitant eyes \nI turned my face to the festering sky. There, I saw the horror that \ncannot be unseen, learned what cannot become unknown. I pray now \nonly that the end I see in that hellish stage above comes swiftly, to \ncure me of its vision.\n–Account of the Hadex Anomaly’s rise, circa 658.M41.\nB\negin with an overview of recent events in the Jericho \nReach. Hive Fleet Dagon continues to edge closer \nto the heart of the Crusade. The Tau’s siren song of \nheresy still lodges in too many Imperial ears. More troops \nhave been spent on the Acheros Salient to hold a line that \nshould be advancing. At this point, the GM should recap any \nof the mission consequences with the timing of Opening that \noccur based on the choices so far, or some of the Terrible \nPuzzle pieces from the table below that haven’t come up \nduring the game so far. This is also a good opportunity to \ncover happenings relevant to your individual campaign, and \ndescribe what the Battle-Brothers have done since their last \nMission.\nMission Consequences: The survey of the Acheros Salient \nshould include the effects of the choices involving the royal \nguard and/or Isiaah Faln on the war effort. If the Imperium \nis at war with Aurum, this should be mentioned during the \ndiscussion of the Orpheus Salient. If Prince-Prefect Allewis \nsent his interrogation results, share those at this time.\nA variety of facts must conjoin for the Deathwatch to \ncomprehend the true magnitude of the threat Dahzak poses. \nTable 3–2: A Terrible Puzzle (see page 99) lists the facts that \nthe masters of the Vigil need before them to recognise the \nmenace forming. It is possible for the player characters to \nbe the ones to uncover one or more of these facts, either as \nfollow up from a previous adventure in this book (for example, \nresearching the diode schematic) or as a part of intermediate \nMissions of the GM’s own devising. The exception is the \nlast piece of information about the antisonate plating. This \nknowledge is the trigger for the third Mission. \nKnow Them By Their worKs\nThe Kill-team faces many decisions in the line of duty. \nThese choices range from what advice to give a king to \nwhether or not to dig through a cluttered room. Large \nand small, the repercussions of these choices follow \nthem. Table 3–1: Mission Consequences (see page \n96) summarises some of the key decisions the Battle-\nBrothers make (or do not make) during The emperor \nproTecTs. The Story Effect column describes how \nyou can convey the results of their actions within the \nnarrative. The Consequence Timing column indicates \nwhen the fact becomes relevant (which may or may \nnot be the best time to communicate it). The Statistical \nEffect describes the mechanical effect on the various \nsituations the Battle-Brothers face during The Sword \nof Vigilance. The table is organised in roughly the \nchronological order that the decisions occurred. Each \nrelevant point in the story also has a note to reference \nthe mission consequences.\n97\nEsteemed Friends,\nI cannot have you believing that my boasts of helpful ears were idle, particularly now that I owe you my life. As \nyou can imagine, we have spent a good deal of time trying to crush the remnants of the conspiracy you uncovered. \nDuring this time, Lord General Iacton encountered a stray member of the apostate Tech-Priests who had a \nhand in recent events. Our prisoner knew precious little that you did not already uncover. However, we did \npersuade him to share some information about his home on Samech. Our Lexographers have sketched a map based \non that intelligence. A copy is included. May it benefit your illustrious organisation.\nYour faithful servant,Prince-Prefect \nAllewis LXXXIII\nThe Princes’s LeTTer\nBelow is a letter from Prince-Prefect Allewis, greeting \nthe Battle-Brothers and informing them of some \ninformation he has received.

The more you \nguide them to assemble this information themselves, the more it \nmakes the Battle-Brothers the owners of the story.\nWhen you are ready to begin The Sword of Vigilance, roleplay \nthrough how the last matter comes to the Kill-team’s attention. \n(Discussing it in character helps to emphasise that the information \nis important, and gets everyone in their character’s mindset). The \npassage below is just one example of how to do this:\nMission Consequences: Change the Watch Captain’s opening \nsentence to a recap of the disruption in the Orpheus Salient’s \ncommunication lines if Lan is infected by the Brood.\nYou stand in a Briefing Theatre with your Watch Captain. Behind \nhim the latest lines of the Crusade fluctuate on the holo-projector. \nColoured shapes wink in and out as the cogitator updates its \ninformation about current battles. Your Watch Captain gestures \njust behind the line of the Iron Collar as he reviews the latest \nintelligence from the watch stations: “Given the proximity of \nPyrathas to the Orpheus Salient, it certainly could be vanguard \norganisms. It bears further scrutiny.” He changes the image on his \ndata slate. “Lastly, there is this report from Watch Station Iobel. \nSamech has been trading for the components of antisonate plating \nin prodigious quantities.“\n“Antisonate plating is costly and has mass limitations. We \nhave never encountered it on anything larger than a Defiler. \nWhatever they are fashioning, it is far larger, and will be all but \nundetectable to most augurs.”\nMost players are eager to be engaged in the story and you \nwon’t have any problems getting them to begin speculating \nand hopefully make the link to the Vinculum Proselytes on \ntheir own. However, if they are slow on their recall or to \nmake connections, their Watch Captain can prod them with \na statement like “You encountered agents of Samech recently, \ndid you not?” If all else fails, the importance of recent events \ndoes not elude the vigilant masters of the Watch. They draw \ntheir own conclusions and summon the Kill-team to the \nbriefing described below.\nWhoever first puts all this information together, PC or \nNPC, brings it to the Chamber of Vigilance’s attention. \nThe Masters of Erioch convene for a short time to discuss. \nDepending on the nature of your campaign, you may wish \nto roleplay through this meeting with the Kill-team in \nattendance. Otherwise, you can simply have the Chamber \nmeet behind closed doors and emerge with their decision. \nTable 3–1: Mission Consequences, Continued \nDecision \nLocationAction Taken\nConsequence \nTimingStory EffectStatistical Effect\nSamech\nContacting the \nsympathisers\nIrradial Forge \nSlums\nThe sympathisers provide \ninformation about the Irradial \nForge district.\n+10 bonus to Tactics and \nConcealment or Silent Move Tests \nwhile in the Forge District\nSamech\nRetrieving Arcus Dyre \nfrom the Soul Alembic\nBreaching the \nOuter Forge Wall\nThe Vinculum Proselytes devote \ntroops to combating Dyre \ninstead of the Battle-Brothers.\nDecreases the number of foes \nguarding the Irradial Forge\nSamech\nFinding and successfully \ninterpreting the anti-\nvenom formula\nXenos Pens\nThe group’s Apothecary learns \nhow to counteract a certain \nvenom\nThe Apothecary can restore \nWounds to anyone poisoned by the \nVenomthrope and inoculate against it.\nTable 3–2: A Terrible Puzzle\nFactPossible Player-Driven DiscoveryPossible Discovery by NPCs\nA faction exists in the Magi of Samech called the \nVinculum Proselytes.

When \nthe Kill-team enters the Chamber, read aloud or paraphrase \nthe following:\n“You enter the domed Chamber of Vigilance. Beneath your feet, \nscriptures of the Codex Astartes are set in the black stone floor \nas you move to join the circle of watch keepers in the room’s \ncentre. They stand round the engraved Deathwatch symbol, \nwith the waning light of Erioch glinting off its metal surfaces \nand casting the Chamber’s membership in the star’s pale, dying \ncolours. Antique servo-skulls slowly orbit the room, stirring the \ntrails of scented smoke which waft from the ceremonial braziers. \nThe circle parts to afford you a space within it; then Watch \nCommander Mordigael speaks.\n“Keepers of the Watch, do you stand your vigil?” The ritual \nopening is short; the Chamber seldom has time to waste when \nit convenes. You chorus back the traditional response with those \nbeside you: “I stand vigilant. The Watch never ends.”\n“The Watch Commander lets the echo of that vow die before he \nsays, “Like the pieces of a terrible puzzle, events are conjoining in \nthe Reach to suggest a picture greater than any single occurrence. \nWho will speak to this threat?”\nYou may wish to select an appropriate rival or rivals to be \nthe voice of dissension; this option works best if the characters \nfeel strongly that the evidence shows a threat. (Otherwise you \nwill end up in a monologue as the NPCs debate.) The opposing \nfaction may truly believe that the evidence is coincidental, or \nrivalry with the Kill-team may have clouded their judgment. \nIn either event, this gives the Kill-team someone to debate \nwith or persuade during the gathering—and a place to focus \ntheir attention in the crowd of NPCs.\nBriefing\nWhen the Chamber of Vigilance agrees to act (as it should \nin the end), Watch Commander Mordigael wastes no time \nin commencing the Mission. He summons the Kill-team into \nthe Chamber if they were not already present (in which case \nyou may wish to describe the environment using the first \ndescriptive passage from the optional encounter). With the \nBattle-Brothers in the ring of Vigil, Mordigael speaks:\n100\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\n“It is true, we have only speculation as to what the so-called \n‘Vinculum Proselytes’ are crafting in their blighted forge. \nHowever, it cannot be denied that some foul power rises there, \nand it means only ill for Mankind. The Chamber of Vigilance \nhas judged that these activities must be halted. Brothers, you have \nkept the watch proudly. Now we ask you to pursue the enemy \nyou have sighted. Samech is a den for traitors to Mankind and \nMachine alike. If they are conjuring a new weapon it can only \nbode ill for the Emperor’s subjects. Find it. Destroy it. See that \ntheir infection does not bleed through the Iron Collar.”\nTo assault the Iron Pit by force would require a massive \nwar fleet, to say nothing of the extra firepower required simly \nto travel that far behind the front lines of the Acheros Salient. \nGiven the compelling evidence, the Crusade is likely to agree \nthat a large operation would be effecive, but that assembling \nsuch a force would take a great deal of time. The Jericho \nReach may not have that time to spare. Therefore, the only \noption is to insert a Kill-team on the Forge World that can \ninfiltrate the targeted forge district rather than to launch a \nfrontal assault.\nWatch Commander Mordigael goes on to inform that \nBattle-Brother Pellas and the Thunder’s Word will take them \nto Samech. The Frigate already eluded the armada above \nSamech once, in a famed mission to recover records from the \nSlaughterhouse. The Emperor’s hand is evident now, as that \nvery data provides the only insights the Deathwatch has into \nSamech. The records describe many of the most influential \nForges on Samech. One such power is the Irradial Forge. \nWhen the conversation turns to the Forge, Battle-Brother \nPellas activates the hololith projectors in the floor. They \ndisplay a short block of data titled “Irradial Forge- Domain of \nthe Vinculum Proselytes.” It contains planetary co-ordinates \nand an embedded pict. The pict is black and white but of good \nquality. It shows a medallion, slightly tarnished, as though \ntaken in the aftermath of a battle. It bears the same symbol as \nthe Magi on Aurum and Karlack: the Radial of Chaos.\nAdditionally, a network of humans who may aid the \nDeathwatch existed at one time on the forge world. Available \ndata is sparse, but these Imperial sympathisers use the symbol \nof a five-pointed star to identify one another. \nEpistolary Axineton interjects, “Not that we have proof they still \nexist. The last record of them is over two hundred years old.” \nMordigael nods to acknowledge the risk. “We must have faith \nthat they still exist. But if they have fallen, our brothers will find \nsome other means of completing their mission.”\nThe following information and rumours may be available \nabout Samech and the Irradial Forge if the Battle-Brothers \nseek to learn more about the planet. Mission Consequence:\nConsider whether the Imperial relays still stand when deciding \nhow much detail to provide.\nthe antiSonate plating\nIf you do want to run an adventure where you reveal the \nfinal piece of the Terrible Puzzle, here is an example set of \ncomponents that could be used to build such a Mission:\n•Background: On the asteroid ring around Dakinor, \nthe Imperial Guard fight an un-ending battle against a \ndeath cult called the Torment. The battle for Dakinor \nhas taken a sudden turn for the worst. The Torment \nhave pushed the Imperial Guard back from several key \npositions in rapid succession. This would be a concern \nfor only the Crusade and not the Deathwatch, if the \nTorment’s sudden victory streak was not built upon a \npowerful assortment of alien technology. The source of \ntheir new armaments is a deal with the Irradial Forge \non Samech. Antisonate plating is refined from rare, \nwave-absorbing ore, and the Torment have located a \nsupply on the nearby planet Veren.\n•Location: Dakinor’s barely-habitable asteroids circle \nthe gas giant, and it is upon these satellites that the \nMission is waged. The visible starscape evokes a sense \nof being exposed directly to the void.\n•Objective: The Primary Objective is to uncover the \nsource of the Torment’s new armaments.\n•Enemies: In addition to the Torment, the Velk’Han \nSept are present at Dakinor when the Kill-team arrives. \nThe Tau are notoriously protective of Veren, and they \nlaunch a brutal assault on the Torment for violating \nthe planet.\n•Assets: The Velk’Han Sept’s main target is the \nTorment, not the Deathwatch. This means the cult \nis weakened and distracted. Furthermore, the Space \nMarines’ power armour means the thin atmosphere \nand extreme temperatures of the asteroids trouble \nthem far less than most of their opponents.\n•Obstacles: Despite the Battle-Brothers’ equipment, \nthey do not know the peculiarities of the celestial \nbodies like the local foes. The asteroids could present \nall sorts of challenges related to unstable terrain, \ngravity, and other celestial objects. There is also no \nlove lost between the Tau and the Deathwatch, and \nin this case the enemy of my enemy is still my enemy. \nLastly, if the Velk’Han Sept does its job too efficiently, \nthen the Deathwatch may never learn if the cultists \nhad uncovered some alien artefact cache.\n•Choices: Do the Battle-Brothers risk that the Tau \nassault might destroy all answers to the Deathwatch’s \nquestions, or do they fight to protect (at least \ntemporarily) a heretical cult? During the Mission, \nthe Kill-team locates the main armoury where the \nTorment stores their ill-gotten xeno-tech. They have \na fleeting opportunity to detonate the entire asteroid, \nbut the Imperial Guard is embroiled in conflict on \nit. Do they sacrifice the guardsmen to destroy the   \nalien tech?\nIt is a good idea to hold the reveal about the Antisonate \ntrade deal until the end of the adventure, lest its big picture \nmeaning distract from the Mission at hand.\n101\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\n•The forges of Samech trade their barbaric technology \nto anyone who can meet their price. They are crucial to \nkeeping the enemy fleets of the Acheros Salient supplied. \n•The dark forges’ minions stray far across the Jericho \nReach. More than one Battle-Brother has died trying to \nprevent them from capturing forbidden xenos technology \nand furthering their power base.\n•Samech’s leadership is fractured. It does not have one \nruling body. Instead, each of the great forges is an \nindependent district with dictatorship over the affairs \naround their territory. Internecine conflict is common over \ncommerce or secret lore. However, every forge contributes \nships and weapons to Samech’s fleet. In defence of their \nspoils they are united, and no planet in the Reach can \nboast a stronger armada in its orbit.\n•Samech turned against the Imperium and the Adeptus \nMechanicus long before the Hadex Anomaly formed. \nImmersion in the warp breach was just fuel on the flame \nof their depravity. The Jericho Reach has as many legends \nabout the formation of the Anomaly as it has lost worlds. \nOne such tale refers to a forge district that comported with \nthe ruinous powers and revered the mutant even before \nthe birth of the malign rift. The legend implies the forge \nmay have been what summoned the Hadex Anomaly. \n•Particular if the communications relays are still functional, \ninformation on some of the possible targets of opportunity \n(Tertiary Objectives) may be available.\nARMING AND OATH-\nTAKING\nThis Mission has a suggested Requisition Rating of at least \n125, modified by the events with Faln and Aurum per Table \n3–1: Mission Consequences. This Rating is higher than \nthe total of the Objectives, representing the crucial and \nchallenging nature of the Mission. If the Kill-team effectively \nrepresented the Mission’s importance to the Chamber of \nVigilance, each Battle-Brother also receives one bolter \nclip (28 bolts) of Vengeance Rounds. Although this high \nRating opens up many options for equipment, the mission \nauthorities recommend against Terminator armour because \nits size and bulk make it harder to stay undetected. (However, \nForge Master Greyweaver has an obvious enmity for Samech’s \ntech-heretics. He may still be persuaded to issue it to Battle-\nBrothers with the appropriate Renown.) Battle-Brothers who \nrely on special ammunition may wish to requisition more \nclips than usual.\nMission Consequence: If the Battle-Brothers found the \ntrialkaline powder on Karlack, Forge Master Greyweaver \nsuggests treating their power armour and weapons with \na similar anti-corrosive before departing. He theorises that \nsomething in the planet’s toxic environment may pose a \ndanger. If Magos Quezalt owed the Deathwatch a favour, the \nKill-team is also issued the algorithm purifier he provided.\nPrimary Objective: Stop the thaumagramm diodes from \nbeing used to corrupt the warp gate—or whatever equivalent \nmenace the Deathwatch believes grows on Samech. (Veteran \nObjective, 18 Requisition)\nSecondary Objective: Make sure the forces of Chaos are \nnot capable of making more diodes to try again later. (Veteran \nObjective, 13 Requisition)\nSecondary Objective: Destroy whatever means the \nenemy is planning to use to slip past the Iron Collar. (Skilled \nObjective, 12 Requisition)\nSecondary Objective: Kill Dahzak (Skilled Objective, \n12 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Destroy the Paragelle (Veteran \nObjective, 8 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Rescue the Imperial Sympathisers \nfrom the Skitarii (Skilled Objective, 7 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Destroy the Defiler Foundry (Skilled \nObjective, 7 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Destroy the Servitor Nursery (Novice \nObjective, 6 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Rescue Arcus Dyre and convince him \nto aid the Mission (Skilled Objective, 7 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Identify the trade in tainted cogitators \n(Skilled Objective, 7 Requisition)\nTertiary Objective: Cause as much damage as possible \nto the infrastructure of Samech without jeopardizing the \nMission (Veteran Objective, 8 Requisition)\nepiStolary axineton \nThe White Consul Librarian is exacting and unsubtle. \nIf you have no NPC with a better reason to oppose \nlaunching a Mission to Samech, Axineton can be used \nas he is usually quick to find fault. Some objections to \nthe proposed Mission may include:\n•The Alpha Legion is renowned for Misdirection: \nThe Battle-Brothers’ reports cite Alpha Legion \ninvolvement in this plot. This Traitor Legion \nis known for spreading false information. This \nis probably an elaborate ruse to divert the \nDeathwatch’s attention from a real threat.\n•The Orpheus Salient is more pressing: The \nDeathwatch does not have time to chase theories. \nEvery day Hive Fleet Dagon draws closer to \nconsuming another planet. The Deathwatch should \nfocus on seeing that the Jericho Reach does not \nsuffer the same fate as Prandium did. (If using a \ndifferent NPC, substitute their pet cause.)\n•The powers of the Charon Stars do not make \nalliances easily: If a Chaos Space Marine sorcerer \nand some faction of Samech really do have a \ntentative alliance, their true aim has to be grander \nthan simply building a ship. The Kill-team should \nseek out the enemy’s real plan, not chase rumours \ninto the Iron Pit.\n More details on Epistolary Axineton can be found \non page 336 of the Deathwatch Rulebook.\n102\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nA Turbulent \nVoyage\n“The empyrean’s foulness bled out through the pores of space, like a \nmurderous infection beneath the skin of reality. There, one cannot \npretend that daemons are not separated from us by a tremulously thin \nveil. I pray I need never enter that place again.”\n–Rogue Trader Kazandus Lan, speaking of the Charon Stars\nS\namech is one of the most well-protected planets in \nthe Acheros Salient, and lies deep behind enemy lines. \nFortunately, no vessel is better suited to make this run \nthan the Thunder’s Word, a Deathwatch Gladius-class frigate. \nDetails on the Thunder’s Word and its commander, Battle-\nBrother Pellas, can be found on page 335 of the Deathwatch\nRulebook. This is not the first time the vessel has had to slip \ninto the territory of the apostate Magi. However, the last time \ndid not involve deploying forces to the Iron Pit itself. The \nforge world’s atmosphere is choked with pollution and rife \nwith ionisation. This should make the entry of a single drop \npod relatively difficult to detect. From that point on, the Kill-\nteam is on their own.\nLife aboard the Thunder’s Word is very similar to that on \nErioch. Other Deathwatch Space Marines crew the ship, and \nits interior reflects a similar aesthetic to the interior of the \nWatch Fortress. While it lacks the training amenities of the \nmassive fortress, the crew regularly engages in hand-to-hand \nsparring in the limited cargo hold, and the Kill-team are treated \nas brothers in arms by the other Deathwatch Space Marines. \nConversations in transit offer another chance to present the \nplayers with information on targets of opportunity. If the Kill-\nteam engages in extensive discussions with the crew, another \nsubject sure to come up is the ship’s service history.\nBattles of the Thunder’s Word\nThe Slaughterhouse Infiltration: This mission is the reason \nthe Thunder’s Word has the best chance of bringing the Kill-\nteam safely to their destination. The Thunder’s Word bypassed \nSamech’s entire fleet to reach “the Slaughterhouse,” a watch \nstation circling a nightmare world. One of the keys to their \nsuccess was the discovery of “Altaire’s Arrow.” Their Navigator, \nAltaire Vor’cle, discerned a narrow shaft of relatively calm space \nin the turbulence around the Hadex Anomaly. Not only does \nAltaire’s Arrow allow safe passage, but it also helps mask the \npresence of a ship travelling through it.\nThe Defence of Hestus: Removed from all the primary \nbattle fronts, Watch Station Hestus drifts through space like \na rogue moon. It orbits no known celestial body, but slowly \ntravels some incalculable path that keeps it forever in sight of \nthe Jericho Reach. Several years ago, the watch station drew \nthe eye of Chaos raiders thinking to corrupt it into a part of \ntheir arsenal. The Thunder’s Word deployed to investigate the \nsudden cessation of its data beacon. They arrived to face an \nInfidel raider, but it called for aid before they could destroy it. \nWave after wave of Swiftdeath fighters and Infidel class raiders \nassaulted the Thunder’s Word as the foe threw their entire force \nat the Deathwatch vessel. Not only did the Thunder’s Word\nprevail, they completely eliminated the entire raiding fleet.\nSighting of Hive Dagon: In another of the vessel’s better \nknown exploits, the Thunder’s Word’s was the first to discover \nthe Tyranids encroaching on the Jericho Reach and live to \ntell the tale. The crew spins a compelling first-hand account \nof finding the Freya system suddenly emptied of all life, and \nthe morbid puzzle of trying to understand what could have \nwrought such death—followed by the dreadful answer from \nthe assault of two Tyranid drone ships.\nThe Kalenikos Extraction: The Crusade’s landing at the \nbeaches of the Raek Forest cost thousands of Imperial Guard \nlives. As the Fist of the Emperor struggled to maintain their \neroding hold in the sand, reports quickly accumulated of \nan alien presence that seemed hostile to both the Imperium \nand the Tau Empire. The Ordo Xenos covertly began an \ninvestigation, only to be cut off when the Crusade withdrew \nfrom the world. The Thunder’s Word was responsible for the \nlocation and retrieval of the Ordo Xenos operatives before \nthey were lost with the other abandoned souls.\nBattle Wounds\nAs indicated on Table 3–1, if the Kill-team did not end \nthe proscribed trading activities of Alexei Drahj, the Frozen \nTear soon came into conflict with the Thunder’s Word. If this \nhappened, the Thunder’s Word is still obviously healing from \nthat fierce battle. The hull shows many temporary patches \nover long lance fissures, and the plasma drives occasionally \nproduce energy spikes that ripple through the ship. During \nthe journey to Samech, the Techmarines obviously strive \nthe eMperor proteCtS\nThe dying warning of Lamdus Rize was “The Emperor \nProtects.” What did he mean by these words? Dahzak \ncommands the foul sorceries of Chaos, and he excels at \nusing them to predict the movements of his enemies. \nHowever, the light of the Emperor blocks his vision. The \nSword of Vigilance contains several points where it is \npossible for Dahzak to use his foretelling against the Kill-\nteam. Space Marines usually swear oaths of valour before \na Mission, and often bear some form of holy icons on \ntheir personages. However, only very specific protections \nfoil the sorcerer’s divination.\nIf the Battle-Brothers interpret the warning as a need \nto seek out the Emperor’s blessing, a priest or Chaplain \nis certainly available on the Watch Fortress to perform \nsuch a rite and affix special purity seals. A successful \nChallenging (+0) Lore: Scholastic (Imperial Creed) \nTest also interprets the warning thusly. If the team \nconsults an NPC on the matter, they might make this test \nfor the characters. Another form of protection is to select \nthe Oath to the Emperor at Oath-Taking. It is possible \nfor the Kill-team to select this oath regardless of Rize’s \nwarning. Even if it was not chosen deliberately, the oath \nstill conveys its protection, although the Battle-Brothers \nmay never know that the Emperor shielded them.\n103\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nto continue the repairs. The ship’s crew recounts how they \nencountered the Tear by chance outside the Quarantined \nWorlds, and their cogitators reported it as a known violator \nof the sanctions against xeno-trafficking from Polyphemos. \nWhen they attempted to board the vessel to assess its purity, \nit opened fire. \nThe Iron Pit\n“These vile innovators have abandoned creed and loyalty, to force \ntheir own whims upon the Omnissiah’s perfect designs. The machine \nis not a slate to sign with your own crude hand. These betrayers will \nlearn the gravity of their mistake.”\n–From the Fabricator General’s declaration of Samech’s \napostasy\nE\nven before its Magi turned traitor, before being consumed \nand expelled by the Hadex Anomaly, the hungry forges of \nthe Adeptus Mechanicus had stripped Samech of resources. \nIt is a land of poisonous waters, soil that cannot support life, \nand strip-mining scars that plunge kilometres into the planet’s \ncrust. These trenches and craters made natural sites to build \nmanufactorum and hab clusters. Consequently, while Samech has \nits share of towers and spires, the majority of its forges burrow into \nthe ground rather than climbing skyward. The planet has been \nplundered to such a degree that the remaining ferrous metals of \nSamech’s outer core are unevenly distributed and shift frequently. \nThis creates strange magnetic currents and fierce electric storms.\nSynthetic protein supports most of the planet’s inhabitants, but \nthe lack of biological material cannot be fully overcome. Most of \nSamech’s genatoriums and vehicles use atomic energy. However, \npromethium is a vital component in certain ancient devices and \nmaintenance rituals that the planet’s Magi have corrupted, but \nnot foresworn. Given its status in the Charon Stars, there is little \nSamech cannot acquire through trade—but the magi were never \ncontent to depend on others for anything so vital, and so they \ndevised the Carbon Transmuter. This machine’s twisting maws \nof pistons and bubbling alchemical vats can take any organic \nmatter and convert it into glistening black promethium. The most \ncommon and easily obtained organic resource is of course human \nmenials. Moreover, the Transmuter is not the only horror with a \ntaste for human flesh in the Irradial Forge district. The mutant \nelite grow more abominable and further removed from humanity \nwith each passing generation. Many consider themselves above \nmanufactured protein rations; this leaves only one plentiful source \nof meat for their refined palates. Between such hunger and the \ntaxing conditions under which the menials labour, Samech \nconsumes life at a voracious pace. The Magi rely on a combination \nof the slave trade and breeding to keep their stock of labour   \nfrom depleting.\nEven the warp has spawned only the weakest parodies of life \nin this barren ecosystem. After a warp intrusion, tainted worlds \noften emerge overrun with daemons and mutated life forms. While \nSamech has its share of both, the warp’s influence took root most \ndeeply in the technology for which the planet is renowned. The \nforges must constantly use sonic emitters to repel rust decapods—\nfist-sized parasites that feed on metal. Their swarms have had a \nprofound effect on the already ravaged planet’s surface. Millennia \nof industry stripped kilometres off the planet’s crust; in some \ncases it came close to reaching Samech’s upper mantle. When \nthe rust decapods evolved, they sought these weak points like \nboreworms seeking exposed flesh. The creatures are impervious \nto heat, and therefore capable of feasting on the planet’s metal-\nrich mantle without harm. The resulting breaches frequently \nerupt in geysers of molten minerals. These volcano-like fissures \ncool into irregular ore masses, which are immediately beset by \nthe parasites until they breach the crust again. Samech sometimes \ntrades rust decapods with the vile forces they favour. All that stops \nthem from being a menace to the entire Acheros Salient is that the \nforces of Chaos are little better at controlling the parasites than \nthe Crusade. Several of the Salient’s early battlefields are now \nquarantine zones full of the destructive creatures that neither side \ncan enter without quickly finding their vehicles and armaments \ndevoured by ravenous decapod swarms. \nAnother strange but less overtly harmful type of fauna are the \nsimuloptera, which are virtually unknown beyond the planet. \nThe original purpose of these nanotech colonies can only be \nspeculated, but they changed drastically once Samech entered \nthe Hadex Anomaly. With chroma-simulator shells, they are the \nperfect chameleon. A hive can range from the mass of a bolter \nto a Thunderhawk, and mimic the appearance of anything with \nequivalent size. \nWhen the Thunder’s Word arrives, read aloud or paraphrase the \nfollowing:\nThe Thunder’s Word has proved true a second time. War \ncruisers and defence satellites vie for space around this bastion of \nunwholesome power. The Thunder’s Word cannot possibly \nremain unseen for long. Below this cloud of the enemy’s vessels \nburns Samech. It is an uneven red rock, covered with lacerations \nof blistering lava and the dark cancers of forge cities whose jagged \ntendrils embrace the planet. Dozens of orbital docks are locked \nin orbit; some have metal umbilical cords that plunge through the \ngray atmosphere to the mechanical placenta of the forges.\nThe Battle-Brothers each receive a teleport homer for \nextraction. However, they must deploy by drop pod. The \ndense, charged nature of Samech’s atmosphere makes it far \ntoo likely that a teleport deployment would land them in \nlava, unstable ground, the heart of a reactor, or some equally   \nlethal hazard.\nSaMeCh\nAnyone familiar with the fronts of the Achilus Crusade \nknows of Samech’s existence, and that it is an apostate \nforge world supplying arms to much of the Acheros \nSalient. Characters trained in Lore: Common (Jericho \nReach) or Lore: Forbidden (Adeptus Mechanicus) know \nmore. Beyond the established intelligence on page 349 \nof the Deathwatch Rulebook, the Imperium has only \nspeculation and unreliable data. (However, see the \nrumours below for some of said speculations.)\n104\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nConditional enCounter: puShing \nthe oddS\nIf the Battle-Brothers ended the threat of Alexei Drahj and \nprevented the conflict where he damaged the Thunder’s Word, \nthe ship slips undetected into Samech’s orbit for a second time. \nIn this case, the drop pod launch goes smoothly. However, if \nthe frigate still bears the damage from their recent battle with \nthe Transpired Circle, the planet’s defence augurs detect the \nerratic energy signature of their plasma drives. The first sign \nof trouble comes only a few moments after translating back \ninto real space. Read aloud or paraphrase the following.\nWithout warning, the Thunder’s Word shudders and tilts \nas a battery salvo reverberates off the hull. The external feeds \nshow several dingy red ships breaking orbit to turn towards your \nvessel. Pellas’s voice comes over the vox system: “Go Brothers! To \nthe drop pods! We will do our duty here. Do yours.”\nHowever, before the Kill-team can reach the drop pod, \nthere is a resounding impact against a nearby bulkhead \nfollowed by the shrieking of tearing metal; the bulkhead \nbegins to spark and melt. Skitarii pour from the boarding \ntorpedo. At this point the Battle-Brothers are 60 metres from \nthe drop pod. The unfailingly loyal soldiers have only one \ngoal: keep the enemy from reaching Samech. They split into \ntwo equal sized groups (the total number of Skitarii should \nbe roughly equal to the number of Battle-Brothers plus four). \nOne attacks the Battle-Brothers, while the other focuses on \ndestroying the drop pod before the Kill-team can launch. The \nKill-team must decide whether they stop the Skitarii from \nwreaking havoc on the Thunder’s Word, or concentrate on \ngetting to the pod and launching their Mission. Should the \nHorde succeed in disabling the drop pod, it takes ten minutes \nand a Difficult (–10) Tech-Use Test to repair the damage. \nThis means the Kill-team must wipe the boarders out to a \nman, or do an unparalleled job of protecting the technician. \nThe Skitarii profile is on page 134.\nINTO THE HEART OF \nDARKNESS\nHe beckoned to the spirit of murder, to the profound evil, to the \ndarkness in the heart of the land.\n–Extract from a Terran cautionary tale\nWhen the Battle-Brothers deploy, read aloud or paraphrase \nthe following:\nThe first few seconds after the drop pod launches are calm in the \nweightless silence of the void. Then you hit Samech’s atmosphere; \nthe pod lurches and rattles as though protesting immersion in this \nvaporous taint. The violent movements buffet your pod, and you \ncan hear the roar of fiery plasma sheathing your descent. This \ngives way abruptly to the thunder of the retro rockets when they \nkick in, slamming your shoulder pads against the top of your \nharness as they slow your fall. The super-heated air around the \npod dissipates and the data screen on the central column displays \nthe rocky ground rushing towards you. With a final jolt, the \ndrop pod hits the rocky surface.\nExcept for the settling dust of your landing, the harsh \nlandscape is still as death. The pitted crags snake endlessly in all \ndirections, and nothing moves under the ruddy sky.\nA smooth, glassy rail lies nearby, running roughly north \nand south. It is perfectly level, and the contrast only serves \nto emphasise how uneven the ravaged land is. The rail spans \nhuge gaps, hanging alone in the air with a gravity-defying \ndisregard for the yawning abysses beneath it. The Kill-team’s \ninformation indicates that this rail line leads north towards \ntheir destination. \nThe first hour of their trek is uneventful. However, when \nthey are a few kilometres out from the forge district, the area’s \nsentry spirits detect the power signatures of their armour. \nSkirmishes between the different forge districts, as well as \nferal machines and raids from scavengers are all common on \nSamech, and the Battle-Brothers are mistaken for just another \nband of raiders. The planet’s magi have devised an infinite \narsenal of blasphemous and lethal technology to defend their \nsecrets. What greets the Battle-Brothers is a type of “improved” \nservitor crafted by Arch-Magos Vayze. These monstrosities \nare a product of Vayze’s long-standing fascination with the \npower to be gained by fusing Samech’s tech heresies with \nthe power of the dark gods. Read aloud or paraphrase   \nthe following:\nYou spot the phalanx of machine-beasts several dozen metres out. \nThe heavy brutes are neither quiet nor agile as they lumber over \nthe jagged terrain. It is as though someone took the most Chaos- \ndeformed mutants they could find, and then covered them with \ncrude augmetics and corroded armour plating. Over time, the \nfoul essence of the creatures beneath have warped the machines \nas well as the flesh.\na Ship in peril\nEven if the Thunder’s Word was not detected initially, \nthere is a limit to how long it can remain hidden in \nSamech’s well-protected orbit. This adventure is full of \ntertiary objectives and colourful content to explore. You \ndo not want to deny your players the chance to explore \nit, but every group’s tolerance for such exploration is \ndifferent. If you need to redirect the focus back to the \nPrimary Objective or increase the sense of urgency, \nthe Thunder’s Word can periodically vox down in an \nincreasing state of peril, urging the Kill-team to hurry \nso that they can be extracted. An Optional Encounter \nassociated with this problem is also provided.\n105\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nThe mutated servitors have no ranged weapons and move \nslowly. The Battle-Brothers have no trouble picking several \nof them off with ranged weapons before they get into close \ncombat. The number of the twisted creatures that actually get \nnear the Kill-team should outnumber them roughly 3 to 2. As \nwith most of Samech’s lava wastes, the ground is rough and \nbroken. Deep crevices and rocky teeth cover the ground. You \nshould emphasise this fact to the players when setting up the \ncombat. If anyone wants to get creative with the terrain, it is a \nfair assumption that a pit and/or extrusion is never more than \nRun distance away.\nMission Consequence: If the Battle-Brothers completed \nthe Divested Hunt they may use the terrain to provide cover \nwith AP 2 as a Free Action.\nIRRADIAL FORGE SLUMS\nOnly a few minutes after dealing with the mutated servitors, \nthe Irradial Forge at last comes into view. Read aloud or \nparaphrase the following:\nAs you proceed, the colossal forge grows on the horizon like a \nrising, malignant sun. Its outline ripples, and you cannot tell if it \nthe effect of the planet’s constant heat, or some shifting property \nof the structure. It is as large as any hive, a twisting complex of \npipes and chimneys and panels. Some portions are meticulously \nordered while others look more like the result of an accident \nthan a design. Eventually a secondary structure emerges in the \ndistance, a few kilometres away from the forge itself: the two \nspiky pillars of the shipyard. Not until you are nearly at the \nend of the rail do the ramshackle slums come into view. They \nare a sad, sprawling clutter of metal boxes. In the shadow of the \nIrradial Forge the flimsy, stunted buildings look more like the \nforge’s rejected offal than the homes of millions. The closer you \ndraw, the more oppressive the heat becomes.\nHere in these slums, the enslaved human menials eke out a \nmeagre existence during the precious few hours they do not \nlabour for the Forge. The Vinculum Proselytes place an emphasis \non breeding volume, so the majority of the Irradial Forge’s \nmenials are born, live, and die on the tainted planet. However, a \nsteady infusion of slaves keeps the gene pool varied and viable. \nA life of privation and toil quickly grinds down the spirit no \nmatter where the slave was born. The menials are as a rule too \ndowntrodden and effectively conditioned to do more than what \ntheir masters demand and scratch in the dirt to survive. They \nwear loose mass-produced coveralls and keep their hair closely \ncropped. While Samech is relatively distant from its corrupted red \nsun, the man-made thinness of the planet’s crust has increased \nthe temperature drastically over the years. Furthermore, the \nmiasma of gases in the atmosphere traps radiant heat. Like an \ninsect under a magnifier, wood, parchment, clothing, and other \nflammable materials are subject to combustion when the sun is \nat its peak. Large pails of inert mineral powder fill every corner \nof the slums, for dousing an unfortunate building or menial who \ncooks too long under the red sun.\nProminent slums locations are detailed on page 107.\nthe BlaCk engine terMinuS\nOne spoke of the translucent rail ends here at the south-\nwestern corner of the slums. A gargantuan iron cage covers \nthe end of the line, where the Black Engine sleeps between \nruns. The cage is presently empty, the doors thrown open. A \nfew metal platforms and corroded loaders surround the cage. \nBeyond this, a wide radius of collapsed structures suggests that \nnothing survives too long close to the engine’s holding place.\nthe proving altarS\nThe corrupt Machine Cultists must still replenish their numbers \nas they succumb to age. Every day dozens die gruesomely on \nthe proving altars, where hopefuls go to implant themselves \nthe BlaCk engine\nThe Black Engine’s rail has criss-crossed Samech for \nthousands of years. Its history stretches back before \nthe Age of Shadow, and some say before the Age of \nMan. The spiked iron beast that presently travels the \nrails is the invention of Samech’s current regime, but \nits efficacy relies on the inimitable phenomenon \nsurrounding the archeotech track. The track does not \nexist solely in the physical world. Anything that touches \nit takes on the same properties, becoming Incorporeal. \nThis allows vehicles upon it to travel without the \nrestraint of physics or air friction, and to ignore any   \nenvironmental hazards.\nUnless one of the Battle-Brothers passes a Difficult \n(–10) Lore: Forbidden (Archeotech) Test, they are \nnot aware of the rumours associated with this device \nand have no reason to shy from the tracks. However, \nif anyone should stand upon the rail, he gains the \nIncorporeal Trait for as long he remains in contact. \nThe GM may also find it adds an interesting dynamic \nto the combat if the Black Engine itself passes by in \nthe middle of the fight. The Round before it arrives, \ndescribe the howling sound generated by the oscillating \nblades around the wheels. The monitoring systems of \ntheir power armour may detect a sudden drop in the \nstifling temperature of Samech’s air. On the next round, \nthe Engine barrels through. It is ten metres long, with \na face carved into a perpetually open maw. Razor sharp \nmetal implements jut forward, forming the impression of \nteeth and a leering tongue. The construct’s body bulges \nin a segmented arch, with each metal plate possessing \na spindle of more blades that slice and spin at anything \nclose to its body. Groaning chains link a baroque ebony \ncarriage to the Engine; the two are roughly equal   \nin size.\nAnyone standing directly on the rail must pass a \nChallenging (+0) Agility Test to leap off in time to \navoid being struck by the Engine.\nShould one of the Battle-Brothers fail this test, they \ntake Damage as though hit by the Engine’s crush attack \nas both they and the Engine are incorporeal at that \nmoment. (See the Black Engine’s profile on page 136). \n106\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nwith the organs of devotion. Each of the eight altars consists \nof a stone operating plinth and a black case that holds organs, \nmedi-sacraments, and ritual instruments. Even under the \npotent stimulants, immune-suppressors, and pain blockers in \nthe sacraments, very few have the skill and the fortitude to \nsurvive such a self-performed operation. However, the reward \nis worth the risk. \nplaza of SuSpended Motion\nThis convergence point of the main thoroughfares through \nthe habs is the decrepit heart of the slums. It is here that \nthe masters of Samech descend to address their drudges, to \nexact fealty, and to mete out punishments. The source of the \nplaza’s name is obvious. The electromagnetic winds and foul \nenergies of the planet flow down the paths to this centre as \nwell, creating a tumultuous field of altered gravity. Many \nferrous objects have been stranded in this anomaly over the \nyears; scraps of steel, combitools, an empty stubber, and even \na bionic leg spin slowly in midair. \nThe field is fickle about what it claims. The Battle-Brothers’ \npower armour fails to interest it, but the GM might decide \nit tugs at a piece of gear or two. This requires an Opposed \nStrength Test against the Field’s Unnatural Strength x2 of 40. \nShould anyone attempt to dislodge an item once it has become \ntrapped, the task is close to impossible—now requiring \nan Opposed Strength Test against Unnatural Strength (x3) \nof 60. However, equipment or abilities like Ferric Lure or \nsimilar approaches to disrupting the magnetic field are   \nquite effective.\nthe Sorting faCility\nAs the Battle-Brothers are sure to discover, the Irradial Forge \nhas developed a sudden thirst for the souls of psykers. In times \npast, the Vinculum Proselytes only paid attention to those \nwith strong psychic potential, putting them down before they \ncould cause harm among the menials. All that changed when \nthey allied with Dahzak. Now they comb the population as \nmeticulously as any Governor extracts tithes for the Black \nShips. Anyone found to have the slightest connection to the \nwarp is whisked away to the ominous Soul Alembic.\nThe Magi razed several dwellings to form an open space \nnear the plaza where they can sift the population for psychic \nenergies. A large mutant named Cyluk is in charge of the \nsorting. One by one he brings that day’s candidates before \na Magos with a psy-tracker. A contingent of Skitarii stand \naround the perimeter of the facility, discouraging onlookers \nand corralling the unfortunates for the next trip on the   \nBlack Engine.\n107\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nthe iMperial SyMpathiSerS\nSeeking out the “sympathisers” is not strictly necessary, but \ntheir knowledge and occupations on Samech can aid the \nBattle-Brothers considerably. \nOn many forge worlds the traditional Imperial cult is \neclipsed by the creed of the Omnissiah. For those labouring \non a planet whose Magi abandoned even the faith of Mars, \nthe Emperor is not even a distant memory. Generations of \nSamech’s downtrodden human population have lived and died \nscarcely understanding that anything dwells beyond their \nchoked red sky. It is only through slaves from off-world that \nany memory lives of the Imperium, or the stars. The nature \nof the sympathisers has fluctuated drastically throughout \ntheir existence, depending on the vision of the members at \nthe time. At the time of the Deathwatch’s last information, \nthe sympathisers had a more concrete understanding of the \noutside and the Imperium than they do today. \nThe current incarnation has no name for the salvation that \nthey whisper lies in “the Beyond,” but they do believe in that \nwhich they cannot name. Bartered slaves still speak of stars, \nand a Golden Man who helps humans move between them. \nFor those seeking some form of hope in amidst the drudgery, \nthose vague ideas are enough to cling to. It is that hope—an \nemotion which has abandoned most of Samech—that unites \nthe sympathisers. They do not even have a name for their \nown organisation; they are a kinship of faith, not words. At \ntheir heart is an older woman named Myrlaine. In her large, \nanarchic shamble of a hab, the sympathisers gather to imagine \nthe Beyond.\nWhile the sympathisers have no scriptures and no religious \ndoctrine, they do have a single artefact that embodies all their \nhopes. This treasure is a worn piece of leather tattooed with \nfine inks. Anyone familiar with interstellar travel recognises \nit immediately as a hand-made star chart. The sympathisers \nhave passed the map between them for centuries, pointing \nat a particular symbol and knowing it is significant without \nunderstanding why. The irregular circle is labelled Samech for \nthose who can read; the menials cannot. Many of the Reach’s \nmost prominent systems are depicted with a five-pointed \nstar—the origin of the sympathiser’s symbol.\nIf the Forges of Samech know about this underground \nfor hope within their domain, they have done little to quell \nit. Perhaps such unreasonable faith in the menials’ reality of \nslavery escaped their rational constructs, or perhaps they see \nthe movement as harmless. The fragile thing has certainly \ncaused them no trouble so far.\nMyrlaine\nMyrlaine is what the menials term “a tender.” Every day \ndozens of menials become incapacitated from disease, \nmalnutrition, exhaustion, and industrial accidents. A tender’s \nduty is to triage the injured and unwell. She cares for the few \nmenials who can be quickly returned to labour, and sentences \nmany more to become fuel for the Irradial Forge. She hides \nher disgust with her duty well, as she knows she would be \nremoved from her role if the ruling powers ever suspected she \nwas anything but mindlessly compliant. \nthe organS of devotion\nThis barbaric initiation practice is common on Samech, \nalthough the particulars of the ritual implants vary \nfrom one forge district to another. In most locations, \nthe case contains cooling units to keep the organic \ncomponents from spoiling too quickly. Some of the \nmost commonly found organs include:\n•The Savant’s Eye – Every survivor has a slightly \ndifferent tale of what this augmetic eye reveals \nwhen they connect it to their optic nerve, but more \nthan one candidate has expired from terror after \ncompleting this step.\n•Necrotic Hand – This implant is meticulously \nreplaced to ensure it does not decay too far. It is \nalways cut from a living person and then allowed \nto age eight days before being placed in the case.\n•Logic Nodule – The composition of this palm-\nsized organ varies widely. Most commonly, it is a \nsmall circuit board or cogitator matrix, but more \nesoteric interpretations also exist. While it grants no \nknown functionality, making space for it in one’s \nchest cavity is an exercise in special calculations.\n•Filament Lung – Used only by the most elite forge \ndistricts, whose preserved ranks of techpriests \nage slowly and can wait decades for a promising \ncandidate to replenish them. This artificial lung is \nan airtight weave of metal and glass. It is one of \nthe most diabolical self-implantation rites because \nthe aspirant must first remove an organic lung to \nexchange for the filament lung.\npatrolS in the forge SluMS\nAs a rule, a life of mental conditioning and toil leaves \nthe menials little room for rebellious intent. Only \nmoderate effort is put into policing the slums, but they \nare not altogether unattended. The Battle-Brothers \noccasionally have to dodge patrols of Skitarii and \nmutated servitors as they move through the city. (The \nGM can include an optional encounter with a patrol \nwhenever pacing calls for more action.) The base \nsize for a patrol should be a group of 6 Skitarii or   \n5 mutants. \nIn their black power armour the Adeptus Astartes \nlook more like constructs than men to a society raised \nwithout the Space Marine’s image. Therefore, the \nhumans react very little to the Kill-team as long as they \nmake no hostile movements. However, if at any time \nthe Battle-Brothers take an action that the GM feels \nwould draw Magos Vayze’s attention (such as getting \ninto combat with a patrol) he should increase the \npatrols per The Time for Subtlety has Passed sidebar \non page 118.\nMission Consequence: Decrease the size of the \npatrols if the Battle-Brothers did not stop Karlack’s \nRoyal Guard from joining the Imperial Guard.\n108\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nMaking ContaCt\nDue to the size of her “family,” Myrlaine and her charges \noccupy a three story building on their own. The Battle-\nBrothers cannot miss it if they pass by. Read aloud or \nparaphrase the following:\nFrom a distance the small hab appears identical to the others \naround it—unique only in the placement of its patches and how \nits skewed angles vary from the equal but differently irregular \nangles of the next hab. However, from the front, the building \nhas something none of the other units do. Every window has a \nfive-pointed star hung in it. Most are irregular, and no two are \ncut the same. They are fashioned from foil and plastic and scraps \nof canvas.\nIf the Battle-Brothers choose to approach the building, one \nof the recovering tenants spots them first. The man—who \nhas a large, dirty bandage around his head and his arm in \na sling—stares at the walking suits of metal. His or her \nexpression is too stunned to convey any form of fear. When \nthe Space Marines speak or get closer, he begins shouting \nwordlessly and pitching nearby debris (harmlessly) at them. \nMyrlaine emerges from the door a moment later. Read aloud \nor paraphrase the following:\nA stout woman steps out of the hab and eyes you. “What beyis \nthis? New machine-men to run about? Well what beyare you \ndoing here? I don’t need trouble at my door” She addresses you in \na rhetorical tone. Servitors do not speak and she is obviously not \nexpecting an answer. She reaches out her hands as though about \nto try shoving you on your way.\nMyrlaine is quite startled to realise that these tall, (mostly) \nmetal-clad creatures are not servitors, but recovers quickly. \nThe only obstacle to getting her aid is that she and the \nother sympathisers have never heard of the Adeptus Astartes. \nHowever, Imperial symbols or even the mere mention of \nspace travel and other planets is all it takes to convince them. \nTheir precise opinion of the Kill-team depends on how they \ndescribe themselves and their task, but the sympathisers are \npre-disposed to think of them in familiar terms. If they gain a \nrough understanding of the Space Marines or the Deathwatch, \nthey call them “The Golden Man’s Sentinels.”\nThe other sympathisers include 3 forge workers named \nAltus, Syrik, and Humour, who—like the majority of \nSamech’s population—labour in the manufactorum, applying \npatterns by rote to small cogs in a large machine they will \nnever understand. Dalton is a food processor who keeps the \nDispensary running, and their last regular member is a man \nnamed Rij. Rij is a cadalvager. He has the unsavoury task \ngathering those who die in Myrlaine’s care as well as bodies \nfrom the slums, and sorting through them to determine \nthe best use for each: corpse-servitors, food, or fuel. The \nsympathisers seem more relaxed if the Space Marines remove \ntheir helmets. This makes them look more like men and less \nlike the mechanical horrors that dominate Samech. \nWords of Advice\nNone of the menials have ever been inside the Irradial Forge \nitself, but they give whatever aid they can to these agents \nof The Beyond. First and foremost, the sympathisers know \na great deal about the forge district. They can describe the \nslums, the shipyards, current happenings, and the most \ncommon forces serving the Magi. An overview from them \nprovides the Kill-team with a +10 bonus to any Tests where a \nlay of the land would be beneficial, such as Silent Move Tests \nto sneak through the city while avoiding patrols, or Tactics \nTests to choose a defensible position. They can also offer \nadvice on some of the Kill-team’s objectives, which might \ninclude:\n•There is no doubt that activity in the shipyards has \nincreased of late. The number of menials assigned to \nlabour there has easily tripled in recent years, and vehicles \nconstantly run between the yards and the forge. The \nperimeter is not guarded, but none of the sympathisers \nhave ever been inside. One of the manufactorum workers \noffers to slip into a shipyard work crew and report what \nhe sees if the Battle-Brothers so wish.\n•Arcus Dyre could be a powerful ally, scapegoat, or \ndistraction if the Kill-team wants to use him. Dyre \nis a powerful psyker. On a planet with little exposure \nto the Imperial Creed, this carries no stigma in the \nmenial population. The Vinculum Proselytes’ practice \nof harvesting them means that they have caused few \naccidental warp incursions. For many years Dyre was \nthe source of great damage to the Irradial Forge. He was \na one-man resistance army, and the only open freedom \nfighter the district has ever known. (There is not a small \nCyluk\nIn the Irradial Forge district, mutation is a sign of \nfavour. Those who develop debilitating mutations \nare quietly put down, and only those creatures who \nexemplify superhuman traits survive to become the \ntaskmasters and overseers in the slums. The Vinculum \nProselytes encourage the degenerates to abuse the \nmenials, keeping their privileged class sated with petty \ncruelty and the slave class broken in fear and despair.\nSpeeCh patternS of the MenialS\nWarhammer 40,000 is full of planets that have \ndeveloped language idiosyncrasies over long separation \nfrom the Imperium. The read-aloud dialogue for the \nmenials is written with a small twist on the verb “to \nbe.” Whenever it is used in its present tense, “bey” \nis concatenated at the front of the usual verb tense, \nturning am into beyam, are into beyare, and so on. If \nyou find this too cumbersome to roleplay, feel free to \nswitch the verb tense back to good old Low Gothic: \nam, is, are.\n109\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\namount of admiration in the sympathisers’ voices when \nthey speak of him.) A short time ago, his rebellion finally \nended in capture. He was only recently taken to the Soul \nAlembic. If the Kill-team could free him, he has nothing \nbut malice for the Forge and its masters.\n•Rij trucks corpses up to the very gates of the Forge \nitself. If the Battle-Brothers wanted to masquerade as \nrecently deceased, their size would be unusual but not \nproblematic. The Proselytes favour physically capable \ntemplates drawn from the planet’s mutants. However, \nthey would need to take off their armour to blend in, \nwhich poses obvious drawbacks.\nthe diSpenSary\nWith no flora and no organic fauna to speak of, the menials \nare utterly reliant on the Irradial Forge to feed them. A hungry \nworker is a less productive worker, and the Forge’s Magi run \nexact calculations to ensure the optimal mass of protein ships \nto the dispensary each day. Inevitably, these rations fall short. \nNot by intent, but through theft, spoilage, and neglect. \nTwice a day, crowds form and conflict ignites as the \ndispensary hands out corpse starch wafers and amino strings. \nThis is an opportunity to see the menials at their worst. Men \nbludgeon one another with rocks and pipes to be first in line; \npeople shove and jostle, and anyone who falls to the ground \nis crushed under the press of bodies. Every few days someone \ntries to scale the outside of the dispensary to reach the higher \nfloors where the rations are stored. To prevent such escapades, \nthe dispensary’s outer walls are coated with heat-intensifying \nfoil. A would-be liberator is lucky to fall back to the ground \nwith major burns. The charred skeletons of a few more \nstubborn individuals are permanently fused to the building. \nYet always, someone else is hungry enough to think they can \nsucceed where the last man failed.\nSome days, members of the mutant elite come to watch the \nsport. If the show fails to be bloody enough for them, they \nremove some of the food to up the crowd’s desperation. \nthe paragelle’S SanCtuM\nTo be sure, the heretical leanings of Samech meant that \nimmersion in the Hadex Anomaly was a less drastic change \nthan it was for many neighbours. Still, nothing escapes the \nwarp without unwanted side effects. The daemonic entity \nknown as the Paragelle is one such example. Since the swollen \ncorona of the Anomaly first receded, this creature has quietly \nfestered in the Irradial Forge. It provides no end of fear and \nanger for her to manipulate, and it has a numerical symmetry \nwhich pleases her. Magos Vayze is well aware of her existence, \nbut by his calculations it is easier to keep her sated on blood \nand violence than to risk provoking her into wreaking havoc. \nThe Paragelle feeds on murder and bloodlust. In such a \ndown-trodden population, these emotions take little effort to \nkindle. Once they ignite, a lifetime of pain and oppression \nquickly turns the Paragelle’s victims into a blaze of hatred and \naggression—a banquet that she savours until it grows stale, \nwhen her current protégé is sacrificed to nurture her next \nwork. The daemon takes the form of a voluptuous copper-\nhaired woman calling herself Lady Anshelene. This charming \nbeauty in scarlet robes stands out in the slums like a flower \nin a desert. The menials do not question her existence, or \nher absurdly clean and intact dwelling—just across from \nwhere the crowds gather and riot at the Dispensary. She is \nan artefact of the environment, as fixed and accepted as the \nIrradial Forge itself. However, the Battle-Brothers cannot miss \nthe conspicuous building and inhabitant if they pass by. Read \naloud or paraphrase the following:\nBetween two of the grime-caked, scorched hab structures stands \na grey marble villa. Columned steps lead down to a harsh line \nof contrast with the dead earth. Only gauze shields the arched \nwindows, fluttering in an absent wind. Behind this veil you see \na woman’s silhouette moving, leaning over to whisper in the ear \nof a guest. You observe that her shape has the curves men find \npleasing—just as you might note that a bolt shell is cylindrical. \nThe Paragelle recognises Space Marines for what they are, \nand is certain of two things: They are a risk to her existence, \nand delicious violence is sure to follow in their footsteps. Once \nshe is aware of them, the warp entity does her best to avoid \ntheir attention. However, she is hardly inconspicuous, and an \nOrdinary (+10) Psyniscience Test detects uneasy warp \ncurrents around her. If the Battle-Brothers interact with her, she \nputs on her best show of support for their cause. She presents \nherself as a slave from a bordering world, and the forced \nbride of the former overseer. After his death, she managed to \nretain his holdings. She does her best to comfort her suffering \npeers—or so she says. She lavishes the Space Marines with \nencouragement to fight for the menials’ betterment.\nthe legend of \nlady Mira BraChelva\nLore from early in the Age of Shadow tells of the Lord \nBrachelva of Bolgra, who was so enraptured by the \nbeauty of the hive commoner Mira that he married \nher and raised her to be his Lady. Here, the accounts \nbegin to differ. In some versions he was a cruel and \njealous man who kept her locked away until she went \nmad from isolation. In others Mira was the cunning \ntemptress, plotting to betray her husband since their \nwedding night.\nRegardless of her motive, all the stories agree \nthat Mira turned her husband’s guards and soldiers \nagainst him one by one, filling them with jealousy \nand devotion to her. One bloody night, she set the \nentire spire against itself. A hundred jealous suitors \ndispatched her husband in an instant, and then turned \nto killing one another for her favour. By sunrise, the \nlovely woman was alone in a home turned red for   \nher pleasure.\nSome whisper that that Mira eventually found a \nnew husband, one who appreciated her inner “beauty” \nand granted her many tender gifts.\n110\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nIf they press “Lady Anshelene” for more active assistance, \nthe Paragelle’s greed for the souls of such perfect warriors \ntempts her to risk exposing her nature. She insinuates that \nshe might be able to turn some of their enemies against one \nanother. However, she claims to fear for her own safety during \nthe fallout. She says:\n“Let us make sure we have an accord. You seek my aid, and will \naccept all the consequences it brings?”\nIf her suddenly serious tone is not enough to make \nthe righteous wary, an Easy (+30) Lore: Forbidden \n(Daemonology) Test, or an Ordinary (+10) Test on some \nother appropriate Lore (such as Occult or Warp) immediately \nrecognises the makings of a daemonic pact. The Paragelle \ndoes not attack the Space Marines unless they force a \nconfrontation. If they see through to her true nature, they \nmay be able to use this to stage an Assault on their terms.\nTHE SHIPYARDS\nThe shipyards lie outside the main forge. Here, the dark Tech \nAdepts construct the stealth vessel that will be used to slip \npast the Iron Collar to the warp gate. The facility consists of \na wide atmospheric platform and two orbital docking towers \nthat stretch into space. Menials and servitors haul materials \nbetween the different structures, while the attendant tech-\npriest oversees operations from his small orchestration station. \nOn close approach, easily the most noticeable feature of the \ndocks is the Mars-Pattern Titan splayed between the two \ndocking towers. Read aloud or paraphrase the following:\nYour eyes are drawn immediately to the blocky, bipedal war \nmachine between the two docking towers. The battered Titan has \nbeen posed in a gesture of defeat and servitude; it kneels with its \ngun barrel arms stretched between the spires. Even on its knees the \ngod-machine is nearly a hundred feet tall. It appears the noble \nmind-core could not be subverted by the apostates, and they had \nto console themselves with making it into a trophy.\nAny character with the Lore: Common (War) Skill should \nmake an Easy (+30) Test. Success identifies the Titan as a \nMars-pattern Warlord class. Success by three or more Degrees \nidentifies its heraldry as the lost Astrum Conflagro, which \ndisappeared from the pages of history when this region of \nspace was still the Jericho Sector. The god-machine deserved \na better end than its humiliation here in the Charon Stars.\nUnlike many of the other slave labourers in the forge \ndistrict, the humans in the shipyard have equipment that \ncould almost be used as weapons. They carry plasma torches \nand similar advanced cutting implements necessary to build \nwarships. They might be swayed to rise up by a convincing \nspeaker—although the cost in their lives would be great. The \nServitors are not combat models. During any fighting, they \nare at worst obstacles and at best cover. A ring of Skitarii \nsurrounds the yard, spaced roughly twenty metres apart \nfrom one another. Before the Battle-Brothers can enter the \nyards, they have to get through the guards. Should this be \naccomplished via combat, there are 12 Skitarii here. \nthe daeMon’S Bargain\nIt is against a loyal Space Marine’s nature to make a \nbargain like the one the Paragelle offers. While the \nGrey Knights may be the sworn hunters of daemons, \ncreatures of Chaos are an affront to all Space Marines. \nHowever, for completeness it is worth stating that \naccepting her deal yields 2d10 Corruption Points, and \ndeep ramifications for the soul. Furthermore, it results \nin a loss of 1d10 Renown for the entire Kill-team \nshould it ever be suspected that their success was built \non a corrupt foundation.\na note to the gM on theMe\nIn a traditional Deathwatchgame the player \ncharacters should not be making deals with daemons. \n(That is more the purview of DarK heresy, which \noffers supplements like the raDical’s hanDbooK.) \nThe Paragelle is intended as an enemy for the Kill-\nteam to uncover and slay. You should do your best to \nmake sure she comes across as devious, and the players \ndon’t misinterpret her as one of the “lesser evils” they \nmay have to compromise with. There is nothing minor \nabout the evil of Chaos.\n111\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nThe Battle-Brothers may move from one part of the \nshipyards to another while in combat with the Horde.\natMoSpheriC platforM\nThis platform is clearly the oldest part of the yard; it is \nencrusted with ornamentation and symbols layered on over \nthe centuries. Were one to peel back the strata of heraldry, \nthey could watch the history of the Forge’s changing masters \nplay in reverse. This is the widest of all the construction \nsurfaces. All the work that can be done before ship assembly \nis performed here in atmosphere. One such task is refining \nthe rare glass and alloys to produce antisonate plating. If any \nof the player characters take the ascender up to the top of the \nplatform (or otherwise find a way to view it) read aloud or \nparaphrase the following:\nA small mountain of glassy black stone sits on the centre of the \nplatform. Torches, smelters, bellows, and metal presses surround \nit. Each tool is covered by dozens of sensors and gauges, tracking \npressure and temperature in what is obviously an arduous \nproduction process. Nearby lay a few sheets of the finished \nantisonate material. The thin panels are light-consuming black. \nNothing that touches them reflects, not light or sound or Samech’s \nimplacable heat. They strike the senses more like voids in reality \nthan tangible objects. \nThe Space Marines may startle several menials and have \nto push aside servitors, but nothing on the platform protests \nwhatever the Battle-Brothers choose to do there.\ndoCkMaSter’S Station\nThis small, fortified building would be of little interest were \nit not for two facts. First. the formula for antisonate plating \nis stored in its cogitators, and second, it has an occupant \nwho reports the Battle-Brothers presence and summons \nreinforcements if not swiftly dealt with. A lone tech-priest \nsits in the station, alternately firing out at the Battle-\nBrothers and trying to raise help on the vox. (A call that \na Battle-Brother may attempt to scramble with the proper \nSkill and equipment.) The single door is sealed, requiring a \nChallenging (+0) Tech-Use Test to open. The building \nwas not intended as a combat bunker. Its thin metal walls \nonly provide cover with an AP value of 12. An Ordinary \n(+10) Awareness Test also notes a sliding window to one \nside. This part of the building is weaker and can be broken \nthrough by 15 or more points of Damage.\ndeCavane repoSitory\nThis large storage building is built into the base of the high \ndocking column. The supply of drained Decavane from \nAurum has accumulated here over the years. The room is \nfrigid despite Samech’s blazing exterior. Ice hangs from the \nceiling and frost clings to the walls. Several containers of the \nblackened crystal have been loaded onto palettes, as though \nthe time to transport and install them is near.\nthe high doCking ColuMn\nDozens of these colossal dock structures dot Samech’s \nblazing exterior. The most powerful and influential forge \ndistricts do not just manufacture warp engines and plasma \ndrives; they construct entire warships for the Iron Pit’s \narmada and their debased allies. The ground level entrance \nto the subsonic lift platform is unguarded. It takes several \nminutes to ride all the way up. The tube doors open onto \nthe docking pinion ring where a pile of flimsy void suits \nstands for the labourers’ use. Ships of all sizes berth at \ntitanS\nMany consider Titans to be the ultimate weapons of \nwar in the vast technological arsenal of the Adeptus \nMechanicus. Their Titan Legions only deploy by the \ncommand of Mars itself. These colossal machines carry \nweapons that can pulverise tanks, and their void field \ngenerators allow them to ignore lesser blasts like a man \nmight ignore buzzing insects. Titans require several \ncrew to operate. The crew’s commander, called the \nPrinceps, links his mind with the Titan’s own. This \nrequires years of special attunement and training.\nfreeing the aStruM Conflagro\nThere is a chance the Kill-team may accidentally destroy \nthe imprisoned Titan in their assault on the shipyard (see \nDocking Tower Wreckage, below). If they want a more \ncertain and deliberate path to freeing the noble machine, \npossibilities include a Demolitions Test to blow it free of \nits bindings, or a Tech-Use Test to activate and overload \nits reactor. The GM should allow the Kill-team to use \nany reasonable plan they can devise.\nreport froM inSide\nIf the Battle-Brothers accept the sympathisers’ offer \nto survey the shipyards, the scout reports back that it \nis well-guarded. The forge labourer is not trained in \nassessing battle logistics, but from the picture he paints \nit would be nearly impossible to penetrate without at \nleast alerting the Forge to their presence.\nShifting the BlaMe\nOne of the simplest ways to avoid drawing attention to \ntheir presence is for the Battle-Brothers to have some \nother group participate in the assault and take credit for \nit. If they choose to ally with Arcus Dyre or the Alpha \nLegion, either of them can take credit. Another option \nis for the sympathisers to join the assault. However, \nthey are not combatants and most of them die in the \nretaliation that inevitably follows.\n112\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\neach pinion, in various states of repair and constructions. \nThe malignant, pulsating light of the Hadex Anomaly \nfloods down. Anyone who looks directly at the warp \nbreach automatically gains 1 Corruption Point. The \ndocking pinions are above the atmosphere, in the void \nitself. Therefore the rules for maintaining power armour’s \nenvironmental seal become important should combat break \nout. Treat an armour puncture as being in a gradually \nworsening atmosphere per the rules for vacuum exposure \non page 261 of the Deathwatch Rulebook.\nThe infant Ruin Bringer berths along one of the docking \npinions, an unreflective black shape against the sickly glare \nof the Hadex Anomaly. Its skeleton is complete, showing \nit to be no bigger than a raider class vessel. The antisonate \nplates are half laid, giving the illusion that darkness \nswallows the front half of the ship. No one notices the \nKill-team immediately; they are just tiny shapes roaming \non the monolithic towers. However, if they approach the \nRuin Bringer, they find it actively under construction. More \nmonotasked servitors and several Tech-priests (use the \nprofile from A Stony Sleep on page 91) labour to complete \nthe warship. When they spot the Kill-team, they do not \nfight. Instead, most of the apostates break for the lift \nplatform to try and sound an alarm. If the Tech-priests \nstayed on the docking pinion, the only way back would be \nstraight past the Battle-Brothers. Fortunately for them, the \nzero gravity environment means they have more options. \nThe Tech-priests launch themselves in various directions: \ntowards lower pinions, adjacent pinions, and perhaps \neven straight up. The number of Tech-priests who don’t \nmiscalculate and go free-spinning into the void should \nbe roughly equal to the number of Battle-Brothers. See \npage 210 of the Deathwatch Rulebook for details on zero \ngravity.\nOnce the Kill-team secures the area, they can deal \nwith the vessel as they see fit. Its plasma drive is installed \nalthough the warp drive is not. If the Kill-team’s plan \nfor the Ruin Bringer results in an explosion and they do \nnot detach it from the scaffolding first, it may destabilise \nthe entire docking tower. That could be either a hazard \nor benefit depending on whether the Kill-team prepared \nfor it. You may want to roll 1d10 on Table 3–3: Docking \nTower Wreckage to decide exactly what happens if the \nmain tower collapses. Unless specifically stated in the \nresult, the Astrum Conflagro remains held in bondage by the \natmospheric platform. Destroying the Ruin Bringer alerts \nthe forge to the Kill-team’s presence unless they made \nprovisions for some other group to take credit. \noptional enCounter: payBaCk\nNot all of the Alpha Legion went to Karlack with Lamdus \nRize. A handful of the Chaos Space Marines remained \nbehind, and they survived to learn of the betrayal. They \nare not interested in partnering with the Deathwatch (nor \nwould any loyal Space Marine be likely to embrace a \nTraitor), but they are hungry for revenge. \nAt a time and location of the GM’s choosing, a short-\nburst signal comes over the Battle-Brothers’ vox links:\n“Agents of the Deathwatch, we know your symbol and why you \nhave come. If you want to learn why you are truly here, we are \nbehind the dispensary.”\nthe treaCherouS arrow\nShould the Battle-Brothers delve for more details \non how the Ruin Bringer’s assault was to play out, \nSamech actually intended to use the enemy’s trick \nagainst them. After the Thunder’s Word slipped by \nthem so easily the first time, the Iron Pit investigated \nand eventually located Altair’s Arrow. The Vinculum \nProselytes intended to use this same passage to sneak \nbehind the Iron Collar.\nTable 3–3: Docking Tower Wreckage \nRollResult\n1\nThe docking tower breaks apart above the atmosphere. Some pieces float harmlessly into space while others burn up in the \natmosphere on re-entry. The only effect on the surface of the planet is a meteor display.\n2–3\nThe docking tower crashes southward. It falls across the Black Engine rail, although this does nothing to stop the \nincorporeal construct’s runs. However, a hail of dangerous debris falls in the slums. There are a few casualties and minor \ndamage to the flimsy structures.\n4–5\nThe docking tower crashes into the middle of the slums. The damage to the people and the structures is vast. The psyker \nsorting facility is completely demolished, crushing Cyluk and the rare equipment.\n6-7\nThe docking tower crashes to the north. The slums still suffer the effects of debris but are otherwise untouched. The tower’s \nuprooted foundations demolish the Astrum Conflagro if it is still held in the shipyards. The GM may choose to count this as \nfreeing the Titan at his discretion.\n8-9The docking tower crashes to the east. It destroys one of the Altars of Proving. The slums suffer the effects of debris.\n0\nThe docking tower crashes to the west. The slums and manufactorum suffer catastrophic devastation. Moreover, the Irradial \nForge and its outer wall take damage. The problem of crossing the outer wall is solved, and the gatekeeper forces are reduced \nby 25% as they deal with the ensuing chaos.\n113\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nThe other party refuses to answer any return transmissions. \nIf the Battle-Brothers go to the indicated location, read aloud \nor paraphrase the following:\nThe rear of the dispensary is a desolate slab of ferrocrete. The \ntall buildings on all four sides cast it in nearly perpetual shadow. \nA rusted fence runs the perimeter, although it contains many large \nholes and the gate’s lock has rusted away. Industrial debris and \ndead vermin fill the lot, creating a graveyard for machine and \nanimal alike. As you draw closer, three large shapes step out from \nbehind a cracked pylon; their hands appear empty of weapons. \nDespite the shadows, your auto-senses have no trouble picking \nout the spikes on their power armour, its scaled patterning, and \nthe green and blue colours. They are Alpha Legion Traitors.\nIf they Kill-team doesn’t immediately open fire, the Chaos Space \nMarines begin to speak. If at the beginning or any point thereafter \nthe Kill-team decides the Traitors must die, use the Alpha Legion \nprofile on page 89. The trio’s spokesman is called Tor, although he \ndoesn’t give his name unless asked. He tells the Battle-Brothers that \nhis leader, Lamdus, was betrayed by the men who currently hold \nthe Irradial Forge. They propose a deal: the Alpha Legion’s aid in \nexchange for helping them get inside the Forge so they can have   \ntheir revenge.\nThe Alpha Legion no longer have anything to gain by hiding \nthe truth from the Kill-team, but Dahzak and the Vinculum \nProselytes have much to lose. If the Kill-team asks, Tor tells them \nall that he knows about the real intentions of the remaining \nalliance: to corrupt the warp gate. (Remember that Tor does not \nknow that Dahzak has his own intentions for it.) As long as \nthe conversation does not turn hostile, the Alpha Legion Space \nMarines discuss the details of the plan: the alliance, the diodes \nand the alien technology necessary to perfect them, and the   \nRuin Bringer. \nThey can also explain the psyker culling. Samech’s masters \nnever work for free. Dahzak does not command the tangible \nresources necessary for such on endeavour. Instead, he offered \nthem something no amount of slaves or ore could duplicate. \nHe gave them freedom from the flesh through an ancient ritual. \nHowever, Dahzak—while powerful—cannot rival the first \nLibrarians who created the mighty spell. Achieving the spell’s full \neffect requires a cabal of sorcerers, which Dahzak did not have. \nThe Irradial Forge made the bargain, but the result was flawed. \nIt allowed the Magi to shed their soft flesh, but their life forces \nquickly began to ebb from their metal remains. Only a constant \ninfusion of the bright life force of psykers is able to sustain the \nMagi’s spirits in their divine machines.\nIf the Kill-team drags on the questioning for too long, Tor \ngrows doubtful of their intentions and presses them for an answer \non the deal. The Alpha Legion finds it as unthinkable as the \nDeathwatch to fight shoulder-to-shoulder. However, they can \nsow confusion and distraction during the Kill-team’s operations \nat the shipyards and the forge. Once they penetrate the Irradial \nForge, the teams go their separate ways: the Deathwatch to destroy \nthe diodes, and the Alpha Legion to see the forge complex fall. \nShould the Kill-team agree, the Alpha Legion’s approach to trust \nis simple: \n“Vow to do as we have agreed. Vow it in the name of the \nEmperor.”\nTHE SOUL ALEMBIc\nPsykers are notorious for their ‘brilliant’ souls, shining like beacons \nin the warp. Their light is not the blessed star of the Astronomican. \nIt is an invite to all that is damnable and foul. Where these cursed \nbeings go, only death and mayhem follow.\n–Inquisitor Zayel: Admonitions Against the Warp\nHere, Dahzak’s apprentice distils the warp essence of psykers \ninto transmuter circuits, which are sparking grids of wire and \ncrystal. (If the Space Marines listened to the Alpha Legion, \nthey know it is to sustain the altered Magi.) Due to its unstable \nnature, the Soul Alembic is at the very edge of the Irradial \nForge district, some 300 kilometres from the main complex. \nIf the Kill-team wants to enlist Arcus Dyre (or simply to find \nout where the psykers are going), it is going to be a long \nmarch if they do not find a faster alternative.\ntaking the BlaCk engine\nThe quickest option—although far from the safest— for reaching \nthe Soul Alembic is to board the Black Engine. Should the Battle-\nBrothers decide to use the temperamental machine, they find it \nstraining in its cage at the terminus. Preparing the Black Engine \nfor travel is a three step process. First, the cage must be opened. \nThis requires an Ordinary (+10) Security Test. Then, the Battle-\nBrothers must attach the carriage to the hooks at the back of the \nEngine. This is not an easy process as the Black Engine attempts \nto gore anyone who enters its cage with its bladed body. Finally, it \nmust be wrangled onto the track. A Routine (+20) Awareness \nTest notes strange energy prods outside the cage; if the Engine \nis stunned using one of these weapons, it can be shoved 5 metres \nas a Half Action. The engine starts out 15 metres away from the \nrail, requiring 3 such actions to wrangle it there. Once the Engine \nis above the rail, instinct takes over. The Kill-team has only a few \nseconds to leap into the carriage before the raging machine begins \nits snarling rush down the ethereal track.\nNameClassDmgPenSpecialkg\nEnergy ProdMelee1d10+1 E12Shocking, Special\n†\n4\n†\nThese energy prods are specially attuned to the strange alloys of the Black Engine. If the murderous machine is struck by an energy prod, it automatically \ncounts as Stunned for 1 Round. Multiple hits in a Round are not cumulative. This weapon’s Damage is not based on the force behind it. Therefore the \nwielder does not add his Strength Bonus to Damage. The Energy Prod requires two hands to use.\n114\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nIf the Battle-Brothers prefer not to harness the monster \nthemselves, (assuming he lives) Cyluk sends his catches to the \nAlembic daily. The Kill-team can wait until the mutant and his \nminions prepare the Engine, although they then have to dispatch \nCyluk and several mutated servitors.\nOnce the Engine and carriage set out upon the rail, the \npassengers enter the aetheric world that the ancient rail traverses. \nThe ride is both interminable and swift. The jagged rockscape \nand red sky blur together as they rush past, overlaid by ghostly \nshapes and glass tones that have no place on Samech. The corrupt \nforge world and echoes of some other place mingle as time dilates. \nArrival at the Alembic Lock is sudden, jarring the passengers with \na harsh return to Samech’s dead environment. The adamantine \nprongs hold the engine in place for a few minutes, providing time \nto debark. Then the timed cogs complete their circle, freeing the \nfurious metal beast, and it is gone.\nThe Alembic’s haphazard tower is visible in the \ndistance, and the frantic roar of falling water echoes from   \nthat direction.\noptional enCounter: ruSt \ndeCapodS\nIf the Battle-Brothers make the journey to the Soul Alembic \non foot or by conventional vehicle, they have a long stretch \nof lava geysers and mine chasms to cross before reaching their \ndestination. At any point in the journey, you may read aloud \nor paraphrase the following:\nYou hear a loud scraping and scuttling in the canyon ahead \nto your right. A mass of brown and black chitin boils up the \nside of the fissure and rolls towards you. It comprises hundreds \nof spindly, mud-coloured crabs with six legs and two pairs of \npincers like miniature decapitators. \nRapidly approaching is a single rust decapod swarm. \nRust decapods secrete a vile acid from their shells and claws. \nThis fills the air around them with an acrid smell, and more \nimportantly dissolves artificial materials at an alarming rate. \nWhen the first edge of the horde reaches the Battle-Brothers, \nprovide a vivid description of their effect on metal. An ammo \nclip or a portion of any vehicle suggests what they can do to \nweapons and power armour. The profile for a rust decapod \nswarm can be found on page 137.\nMission Consequence: If the Kill-team noted the \ntrialkaline powder on Karlack, Forge Master Greyweaver \ntreated their armour with a powerful counter-corrosive. This \nnegates the decapods swarm’s Highly Acidic Trait.\nthe uSe of SoulS\n•The creation of transmuter circuits is a three-step process. \nFirst, the Soul Alembic siphons the psykers’ life force \ninto a reservoir. Then, it is concentrates the stolen vitality \ninto a potent mystical essence. Finally, Sethahar transfers \nthis distillate into the reservoirs of the transmuter circuits, \nwhich slowly bleed warp-tainted energy into whatever \nmachine (or tech-priest) they are installed in. Read aloud \nor paraphrase the following:\nThe Soul Alembic is an interlocking mishmash of giant gears, \nlike a ruined clock built into the side of a dam. Discoloured \nwater pours slowly over the device, turning the huge metal cogs. \nIt takes three victims at a time, each plugged into the tines of a \ncoffin-like recess between the churning gears. The psykers’ eyes \nare open but they stare unseeing and unblinking ahead as the \nmachine slowly robs them of life.\nOn the other side from the extraction area is the \ntransmutation altar, where Sethahar creates the circuits. He \nstands there at present, watching some indicator of progress \non when he has collected enough energy to begin. Arcus \nDyre stands out, both on psychic and visual inspection. Of \nthe three men connected to the Alembic, he is the only one \nwho does not look pale and close to death. His psychic power \nfar surpasses the nascent sparks of potential the machine was \ndesigned to extract. A ring of mutated servitors surrounds \nthe Soul Alembic, keeping watch over the operation and the \nnull pens below where the fodder is stored. The polluted \nriver continues to flow that direction after powering the \nSoul Alembic. A rotting layer of body parts drifts on the foul \nsurface. In fact if the Battle-Brothers observe for long, they see \nthe sorcerer issue a command to one of the servitors, which \nmessily plucks a spent psyker’s husk from the machine and \n115\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\ntosses him into the runoff. A moment later, a slick appendage \nof weeping flesh and serrated teeth erupts from beneath \nthe water and pulls the fresh corpse down. Oblivious, the \nservitor shambles down the winding path to retrieve the next   \nenergy source.\nThe lower pens and the Soul Alembic are separated by a \nvertical distance of about 10 metres, and the path between \ntakes a Round to traverse. Only four servitors guard the \npens. Freeing a group of terrified, untrained psykers is a \nrisky proposition, but should any of the characters wish to \ndo so, opening the gate is a Half Action, as is de-activating \nthe nullification field it projects. Above, 6 mutated servitors \nreinforce Sethahar. Any of the psykers can be pulled from the \nmachine as a Half Action. However, those less powerful than \nDyre must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die. \nDyre, on the other hand, only counts as Stunned until he can \npass a Toughness Test.\nMission Consequence: If the Battle-Brothers completed \nthe Divested Hunt they may use the terrain to provide cover \nwith AP 2 as a Free Action.\nThe toxic river runs along the left side of both areas, its \nsurface occasionally disturbed by the terrible things that lurk \nin its depths. Anyone, Space Marine or hostile, who gets too \nclose finds themselves having to make an Opposed Grapple \nTest to avoid being pulled in by a toxic dweller. The profile \nfor the toxic dweller can be found on page 137. Anyone \nwho makes flesh contact with the river’s water must make \nan Ordinary +10 Toughness Test or take 1d10 Wounds \nignoring armour and TB. (Sealed armour is enough to protect \na Space Marine.) The beast may stay within the water, or the \nnoise and bloodshed may lure it onto the bank.\nAfter being rescued, Dyre ransacks the corpses of his \nformer guards for weapons and armour. He is understandably \ncurious to learn about his unexpected benefactors. He is quite \nwilling to aid the Kill-team either by joining them or rallying \nthe surviving psychic rabble to follow him on a campaign \nof revenge. The Forge forces used a treaded, open-topped \ntransport coated in trialkaline to reach the Soul Alembic. It \nis parked near the lower pens, and the Battle-Brothers may \nuse it to return.\nThe Irradial \nForge\n“How easy it is for you to stand upon your pedestal and call my \nsoul deficient. But I say it is you who are deficient. You who are \nthe cowards. The powers do not call to us so because we are weak; \nthey call to us because they are our right. Some day, when you have \nrealised there is no other path, you will mourn the loss of my kind.” \n–Rumoured to be the last words of the condemned sorcerer \nTamrus Blackwell.\nT\nhe towering forge complex goes on for kilometres, \nfurther than the eye can see. It consists of three general \nlayers. Its outskirts are the manufactorum where the \nbulk of the menials labour. A high, fortified wall marks the \nbeginning of the Irradial Forge itself, with heavily guarded \ngates permitting passage between the two. After this is the \nouter layer of the forge, a wilderness of metal chambers, \ngenerators, data vaults, automated factories and devices whose \npurpose not even the apostate Magi can guess. Somewhere \ndeep within that maze is the inner forge, its beating heart \nforged in steel and sorcery—where the Battle-Brothers   \nmust go. \nTHE MANUFAcTORUM\nThe crescent-shaped manufactorum zone is a combination of \nsoot-blackened structures and open pits. These house slow-\nmoving assembly scaffolds and work pits where dozens \nof men weld, hammer, and solder. The inner forge holds \nmany completely automated production lines, but the items \nproduced here require manual labour. The products may \nrequire manipulation too fine for the industrial machine spirits, \nor the Forge may simply lack the STC needed to automate its \nmanufacture. The complete range of items created here is too \ngreat to count, but below are some examples of the different \nproduction facilities. The same forces patrol the manufactorum \nas the slums, with similar risks of an encounter.\narCuS dyre\nMost of the ambition in Samech’s menials dies early \non the altars of proving. There are exceptions; Arcus \nDyre is one of them. Born as a powerful psyker, he \nrejected the planet’s creed of mechanical superiority \nin favour of his own abilities. Had these powers not \nmanifested at a prodigiously early age, he surely would \nhave met a grisly fate in the augmetic hands of the \nVinculum Proselytes. Instead, he shook off the reins \nof servitude and began a one-man campaign against \nthe mutants and magi that held him down. For over \na decade Dyre has wrought his own form of bitter \nrevenge on Samech’s masters. However, Dahzak tired \nof the psyker’s interference, and used his knowledge of \nthe warp to counter Dyre’s only real advantage. The \nproud rebel is finally in null-chains and awaiting death \nbeneath the gears of the Alembic.\nHe has no special regard for the Adeptus Astartes, \nalthough he is keenly interested in the knowledge \nheld by any Librarian he encounters. Gratitude for his \nrescue tempers his characteristic arrogance, and he is \npragmatic and respectful with anyone who reciprocates \nwith courtesy. Like most of Samech’s population, Dyre \nhas little exposure to the Imperial Creed. He is aware of \nthe Emperor only as the enemy of his enemy. However, \nhe is neither a sorcerer nor a devotee of the ruinous \npowers. If he lives through the assault on the forge, \nhe presents an unusual variant of the rogue psyker \nconundrum that the Battle-Brothers (particularly any \nBlack Templars) may want to address.\n116\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nlaSgun ManufaCtory trenCh \nA series of ledges has been carved into the cliff walls. Raw \nmaterials enter the process from the top. The workers on the \nhighest levels weld basic metal plates and sort the focusing \nlenses to find those of sufficient quality. Their output slides \nto the tier below, who stamp and polish these inputs into \nbase components. So the production processes cascades down \nuntil it reaches the bottom of the crevice where finished \nguns are loaded for transport. The frantic pace of input from \nthe top makes efficiency a matter of survival. The flow of \nraw materials never ceases. If any worker falls behind, he is \nliterally crushed by the press from above.\nvoid Shield produCtion pit\nVoid shields are common defensive energy barriers used \non large vehicles such as interstellar craft or Titans. In the \ncentre of this deep pit, huge, cruiser-sized versions are slowly \nconstructed. Menials scurry around the huge apparatus like \nants piling grains of dirt atop their hill. Layer by layer they \napply stabiliser circuitry and projector lenses at the direction \nof the presiding Magos. From his control pulpit, the Vinculum \nProselyte ensures the patterns of construction are followed. \nAt set intervals he flips the Breakers Of Confirmation. These \nlinked switches supply power to the newly-built shields, and \nunseal valves around the pit’s edge that pierce the planet’s \nthin crust. Only if the void shield is functional does it spare \nits creators from the magma jets that erupt from the opened \npassages into the mantle. This keeps the workers motivated \nto perform their tasks quickly and precisely. Inevitably some \nshortage or mishap thwarts their frenzied pace, and the \ncharred bodies must be cleared to make way for the next \ngroup of labourers.\naMMunition CoMpound\nThis vast assembly sty houses thousands of menials in six by \nfour cells. The workers delicately polish, fill, and calibrate \nmunitions ranging from grenades to stubber bullets. In order \nto ensure no one uses this weaponry against the forge, once \na man is placed inside a cell, the door only opens when it is \ntime to remove his spent corpse. The occupants live and sleep \nat their workbenches, carefully placing each finished shell in \nthe judging receptacle. Only when the machine spirit’s scales \ntell it that a menial has met his gruelling production quota \ndoes it fill his bowl with grey nutrient paste.\nSkitarii BunkerS\nThe Skitarii guard largely stay in the manufactorum zone, \nclose to the forge’s wall. Several of these drab, hardened \nbunkers exist in a rough crescent around the perimeter. A \nfew hundred men sleep and drill in each one. Unless the \nBattle-Brothers are seeking random slaughter and to loudly \nannounce their presence, these bunkers are best avoided. \n117\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nthe CarBon tranSMuter\nThe carbon transmuter stands on the east side of the \nmanufactorum pits. This alchemical device can produce \npromethium from organic matter. If the Battle-Brothers near \nit, read aloud or paraphrase the following:\nThe carbon transmuter combines the odours of human waste, \ndecay, and promethium into one terrible miasma that surrounds \nit. The device primarily consists of two large vats, with a series \nof twined distillation tubes leaking thick, foul liquid between the \ntwo. The larger vat has a heavy lid controlled by a pneumatic \npump. It is currently active, the lid pressing down on the contents \nbelow. Several screaming voices echo from within the metal vat.\nA Magnitude 10 Horde of Skitarii guard this important \npiece of equipment. A Skitarii Tribune (see his profile on \npage 135) is also present in a Chimera armoured transport. \nPromethium residue coats the carbon transmuter. If ignited, it \nexplodes like a giant inferno shell. Any hit by a weapon with \nthe Flame Quality automatically ignites, while any Damage \nwith the Energy type has a 25% chance of sparking a fire. The \nresulting explosion does 4d10+10 E Damage to everything \nin a 10 metre radius, and carries the same risk of catching on \nfire as an incendiary grenade. If the Kill-team wants to try to \ncapture the Chimera rather than destroy it, assume it has been \nbreached after it has lost half of its Structural Integrity. Once \nit is breached, a Battle-Brother may enter it and assault the \nTribune directly.\noptional enCounter: defiler \nfoundry\nWhile no Imperial war machine can compare with the might \nof Titans, the daemon-possessed engines known as Defilers \nare some of the most rightly feared weapons in the Chaos \nSpace Marines’ debased arsenal. The process of actually \nbinding the furious daemon into a Defiler requires a skilled \nsorcerer and is beyond the arts of the Irradial Forge alone. \nHowever, each one of the possessed war engines requires a \nmetal hull upon which runes are later etched, ceremonies \nperformed, and ultimately the terrible daemonic machine is \nformed. The Vinculum Proselytes are a major producer of \nthese chassis. \nThe Defiler foundry lies on the northern crest of the \nmanufactorum zone. It is built into the side of a deep crag \nand uses the intense heat of Samech’s cracked crust to smelt \nthe alloys in production. Very few menials survive long in \nthis facility. Not only does the intense heat take its toll, but \nthe foundry has more lethal accidents than any other location \nin the manufactorum zone. Some factions of Samech whisper \nthat the Irradial Forge is attempting to replicate the daemonic \nbinding processes themselves, so that over time the whole \nfoundry has become infused with a malicious will. However, \nthere is no proof.\nFear keeps the foundry isolated. Only a handful of Samech \nSkitarii guard the facility. They would pose no resistance all \nto the Battle-Brothers if it weren’t for their missile launchers \nand the ability to summon reinforcements. Furthermore, the \nfoundry crag is full of narrow tunnels leading between the \nwork areas. The Skitarii can squeeze into these passages, but \nthe Space Marines cannot. This gives the forge soldiers the \nability to move about in relative safety from their attackers. \nThe Battle-Brothers certainly manage to take down some \nof the guards in the opening moments of their assault. Have \nthe Kill-team make an Opposed Test of their Concealment \nversus the Skitarii’s Awareness to determine how close they \nget, and therefore how many of the enemy soldiers they kill \nbefore the rest scatter. Depending on how well the Opposed \nTest went, assume between 4 and 8 Skitarii managed to flee \nand hide. Rounding up the rest of the Skitarii before they can \nescape or call for help becomes a game of cat and mouse. In it, \nthe Space Marines are the cats—very large predatory cats. \nThe goal of the Skitarii is to vox for reinforcements. \nHowever, their microbead vox units do not normally have \nthe range to reach beyond the immediate environs. To boost \nthe signal enough to call for help, a Skitarii must pass a \nChallenging (+0) Tech-Use Test. The Test requires 2 Full \nRound Actions. At the GM’s option it may not spell failure \nfor if the Skitarii manage to call for help, it just may mean \nthe Battle-Brothers have to hurry, or can expect a difficult \nencounter to start bearing down on them.\n Below is a list of the different work areas in the foundry. \nWhen the Skitarii flee, the GM places them amidst the \nfollowing locations in groups of one or two. Let each Battle-\nBrother declare which location he is searching, using the usual \nConcealment vs. Awareness Opposed Test. When a Skitarii is \nlocated, play out the combat normally (which should not take \nvery long). See page 120 for the profile of a Samech-pattern \nMissile Launcher. An un-detected Skitarii may use the tunnels \nto move between locations in 1 Round. It takes 2 Rounds for \na Battle-Brother to change locations and 1 Round to search \na location.\nMission Consequence: If the Battle-Brothers completed \nthe Divested Hunt they may use the terrain to provide cover \nat AP 2 as a Free Action.\nthe tiMe for SuBtlety haS \npaSSed\nAt some point the occupants of the Irradial Forge \nrealise that not only are hostiles in the district, but \nthat they are loyal Space Marines assaulting the forge. \nWhenever Dahzak and the Vinculum Proselytes make \nthis discovery, it has the following effects:\n• The number and size of the patrols in the slums \nand manufactorum increase. The Battle-Brothers \nmust more frequently work to avoid them.\n• The number of guards around the shipyard doubles \n(if the Battle-Brothers haven’t assaulted it yet).\n•Add two gate guardians to the number faced after \ncrossing the outer forge wall.\n118\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nFoundry Locations\nSmelting Moulds\nThe moulds for each of a Defiler’s parts are cast in stone. The \nmoulds heat and cool with the flux of Samech’s subterranean \nmagma tides. At high tide they grow hot enough to quickly \nsmelt ore, the impurities separated by the electromagnetic \nfields. The impurities can then be skimmed from the surface \nof the mould. As the magma tide rolls out, the remaining \nmetal cools—casting the pieces for assembly.\nPiston Assembly\nDefilers move on six piston-like legs. Here the cooled metal \nis finished, and the heavy armour plating welded into place. \nRow after row of the giant, bladed appendages form a metal \nforest for the Skitarii to hide in.\nActuator Production\nHere, menials machine the hundreds of small moving parts \nthat make up a Defiler. Each part must be strong enough \nto endure the thrashings of a bound daemon, yet perfectly \nshaped and calibrated so the war machine performs optimally. \nBecause of the intense amount of manual labour needed to \nproduce these parts, this location is crowded with menials. \nReaper Autocannon Production\nThe Reaper autocannon is manufactured here, beginning \nwith smaller, lava-heated moulds all the way through the \nfinal finishing and fire-testing. Unfortunately each finished \ngun can only be tested on a special trigger assembly, which \ndoes not pivot. Unless the Battle-Brothers are kind enough to \nstand right in front of the guns, the autocannons pose little \nthreat to them.\ndeStroying the foundry\nThe Kill-team may want to do some collateral damage \nto Samech at this important enemy site. Several ways \nexist to damage or destroy the Defiler foundry. Below \nare only a few possibilities.\n•A Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test can link \nseveral of the weapons in the weapon depot together \ninto a barrage of fire that decimates the facility.\n•By using up all of their grenades (a generous GM \nmight allow each Battle-Brother to keep one) and \npassing a Challenging (+0) Demolitions Tests, \nthe Kill-team can cause a rockslide that collapses \nthe cliff where the foundry is built.\n•At “high tide” for the magma seas of Samech, a \nRoutine (+10) Survival Test can strategically \ndamage the smelting molds, turning them into \nfunnels for the melting ore and magma. The \ndegrees of success achieved determine how much \nof the facility is drowned in the molten metal.\n119\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nWeapon Depot\nThe other weapons for these war machines: twin-linked \nflamers, huge close combat appendages, lascannons, and \nbattle cannons are not manufactured here. These armaments \nare shipped in from other locations and stored here until they \ncan be installed. Unfortunately these weapons do the Skitarii \nno more good than the Reaper autocannon. They are far \ntoo heavy for a single man to wield, and in many cases not \nequipped with a manual trigger.\nTHE OUTER FORGE wALL\nBeyond the manufactorum pits lies the forge, but an open \napproach over the cracked earth and a tall iron wall separate it \nfrom where the menials may tread. Heavy gun emplacements \ntop the walls, and each fortified gate is heavily guarded. The \nBattle-Brothers have several options for making it across this \nfiring range:\n•Accept Rij’s offer to pose as servitor material or devise \nsome other method of hiding in a vehicle that can \napproach the gate.\n•Try to blast through or climb over the gate. These \napproaches bypass some of the more interesting \nroleplaying opportunities, so the GM can set the exact \nDifficulty of these tasks depending on how feasible he \nwants the options to be.\n•Have some of the Kill-team’s allies create a distraction. \nAny of the potential sources of aid on Samech can launch \nan attack near a gate, drawing the attention of its guards \nand guns. For each of the gun emplacements, make an \nOpposed Test between the Leader’s Concealment and \nthe emplacement’s awareness of 30. The Kill-team gains \na +20 Bonus to this Test because the gunners’ attention \nis elsewhere. As with other violent endeavours, if the \nsympathisers participate, they take heavy casualties.\n•Take a cue from the Alpha Legion’s infiltration on Karlack. \nThe Battle-Brothers have the opportunity to acquire a \nChimera transport at the carbon transmuter. At the very \nleast they are able to approach the wall in the vehicle. \nDepending on their ability to bluff and the alertness of \nthe guards, they may be able to make it through to the \nother side.\noptional enCounter: the BeSt laid \nplanS\nIf the Battle-Brothers made contact with the sympathisers, \njust as they near the gates, they receive a panicked vox \ntransmission:\nA broken, static-filled signal sounds from your vox. It sounds like \nMyrlaine’s voice. “Not sure how...discovered...Too many...”\nThe Irradial Forge followed the recent trail of carnage left \nby the Battle-Brothers, and it led them to the sympathisers. \nThe Vinculum Proselytes may not have proof that Myrlaine \nand the hab’s occupants did anything wrong, but they prefer \nto make an example of them just the same. The Kill-team must \ndecide quickly. Do they throw away their careful approach \nand return to the slums to rescue the menials who helped \nthem, or do they press on with the Mission?\nIf they return, the Kill-team arrives at sunrise or sunset \n(whichever makes more sense based on the time of day) as a \nrumbling crowd forms around the dispensary. As usual, several \nof the mutant elite are present, goading and taunting. Outside \nMyrlaine’s hab, a large force of Skitarii and mutated servitors \nforms combat squads. If they spot the Space Marines, they \nquickly turn their attention towards that larger threat. There \nare 6 mutated servitors and enough Skitarii to form a Horde \nof Magnitude 20. If combat breaks out, it is a cacophonous \nbattle that reverberates through the slums. \nCharge!\nIf, codex tactics to the contrary, the Battle-Brothers decide to make a frontal assault on the gate, use the following information. \nThe exterior is defended by Samech-pattern assault cannons, the profile for which can be found below. Assume 4 guns can \nface any approach angle. The shortest distance from the edge of the manufactorum pits to a gate is 100 metres.\nSaMeCh pattern weaponS\nName Class Range RoF Dmg Pen Clip Rld Special kg\nAssault Cannon\n (Samech Pattern) \nMounted 120m –/–/10 3d10+6 I 5 200† 2 Full† Tearing 70\nMissile Launcher (Samech \nPattern)††\nHeavy250mS/–/–3d10+10 X61Full40\n†Clip and Reload times are for mobile versions of this weapon.

The view of the \ndispensary is so that the GM has a firm vision of what \nis occurring off screen and when. Unless any of the \nplayer characters are at the dispensary, there is no need \nto actually convey that action to the players. They will \nsee its consequences soon enough.\n120\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nThe dispensary doors open and the mutants begin their \nusual sport. However, when the crowd at the dispensary \nrealises someone is fighting (and hopefully winning) against \nthe Irradial Forge’s minions, it ripples through the agitated \nmob like an explosion. Although the Kill-team might not be \nable to see it, the menials turn on the mutants. On the 3rd \nRound of combat at the hab, the remaining Magnitude of \nthe Horde suddenly halves as the Skitarii go to deal with the \ndeveloping riot. The Battle-Brothers can make an Awareness \ncheck to hear the sounds of combat blocks away. On the 7th \nRound (should the Space Marines still be in combat) the \nremaining enemies break as the menials’ own Horde spreads \nout through the city. \nBy the time the Kill-team makes their way back to the \nwall, the riots have spilled into the manufactorum pits, \nengulfing the district in blood and turmoil. This counts as \na distraction for purposes of reaching the wall and draws so \nmany guards into the slums that only 2 of the 4 approach \nguns are manned.\nBEYOND THE wALL\nRegardless of how they reached the other side of the wall, the \nouter forge awaits the Kill-team. Read aloud or paraphrase \nthe following:\nOn the other side of the wall is a technological jungle. Forgotten \ntransmission towers jut above shorter knots of pipes and wires. \nMysterious cylinders and processing tubes rise at intervals like the \ntrunks of ancient trees over an undergrowth of drab but irregular \nmetal structures. A mirage-like sheen ripples across this primeval \nrange—an oil slick of unreality from the tainted energies that \ninfuse Samech.\nRising like a foreboding temple in the midst of this wilderness \nis the Irradial Forge. It is the heart that pumps Chaos-tinged \nblood through the machines, and it appears as nothing less than \nan exercise in controlled chaos. Even as you watch, its spires \nand churning furnaces change slowly, evolving like the patterned \nrandomness of a kaleidoscope. Octagons and eight-pointed shapes \nrecur in the shifting structures. A pair of turrets quadruples; a \ngargoyle brandishes its four-toed limbs.\nYou don’t have long to take in the blasphemous sight before the \nForge’s guardians herald their approach with a thunder of slow, \nominous footsteps. Hulking amalgams of flesh and metal emerge \nfrom the industrial wasteland. Each one stands slightly larger \nthan a Terminator, and it is difficult to tell where the armour \nplates end and the grotesque misshapen flesh begins. Even as they \napproach, their limbs twist to form heavy weapons.\nThese are the walking arsenals called Obliterators. The exact \nnumber present depends on how threatened the Vinculum \nProselytes feel at present, and what else is competing for the \ngatekeepers’ attention. The baseline number of Obliterators \nis equal to one less than the number of Battle-Brothers. If \nthey drew attention to themselves in the slums, increase the \nnumber of Obliterators by 25% (round down). \nThe Obliterators emerge from the metal debris when the Kill-\nteam is about 20 metres away from it. They do not attempt to \ntake cover in the wreckage, trusting in their armoured skin and \ndaemonic nature to protect them. However, if the Battle-Brothers \ndecide to make use of this terrain, it provides 1d10+2 AP   \nof cover.\nMission Consequences: If the Battle-Brothers are not girded \nwith litanies of the Emperor, Dahzak was able to divine that \nan assault would be coming soon. He increased the number of \ngate keepers as a precautionary measure; increase the number of \nObliterators by 25%. If enemies the forge considers formidable—\neither Dyre or the Alpha Legion— are currently drawing fire, \nreduce the number of Obliterators by 25%, or 50% if both are \nassisting. Note that any riots in the slums have no effect on \nthe number of guardians, as they are elite forces reserved for \nprotecting the Forge itself, not dealing with rowdy menials.\noBliteratorS\nA blasphemous melding of flesh and metal, these hulking \nabominations bristle with weaponry formed from the \nstuff of their own tainted bodies. Metal plates overlap \ntwisted sinews and plasma runs through cable-like \nveins. The fluid transformations of these bizarre cyborgs \nspeaks of a techno-arcana that is only possible through \nthe intercession of the Ruinous Powers. Whatever \ntheir origin, these daemonkin bring thundering death \nwith salvo after salvo of their hell-forged armaments. \nObliterators can be found in the service of anyone with \nthe technology and forbidden knowledge to further the \nhybrids’ personal power and weapons.\n121\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nthe Maze of Metal\nThe outer forge is too dense to traverse in a vehicle (and it is a \ntight fit at times if anyone opted to wear Terminator armour). \nThe Battle-Brothers have to disembark from any transports to \nenter this mechanised no-man’s land. Somewhere within this \nshifting maze of technology lies the Irradial Forge’s corrupted \nsoul. If the Kill-team received the map from Allewis, they have \nlittle difficulty pin-pointing the direction they need to go. \nOtherwise, they must find their way to the heart of the forge \non their own. \nThe Obliterators were not the last of their terrifying kind in \nthe outer forge. The Space Marines must be alert and stealthy \nas they move through the outer forge. Otherwise they risk not \nonly telegraphing their approach to the Forge, but also drawing \nmore fire. Below are some locations in the outer forge. Chaotic \nenergies have immersed the area for centuries, to the point that \ndirection has little meaning. When the Battle-Brothers set out, \nroll 1d10 on Table 3–4: Travel in the Outer Forge to determine \nwhere they arrive and how long it takes to get there. Each time \nthey traverse the forge, one member of the Kill-team may elect \nto make a Difficult (–10) Navigation (Surface) Test. Add \nthe degrees of success or subtract the degrees of failure from the \nnext roll for Location. Each traversal also carries a possibility \nof encountering a patrol of Obliterators and/or fleshless magi. \n(The GM can decide the exact chances and patrol composition.) \nAdditionally, the GM can insert his own locations into the mix \n(in which case he will need to modify the table).\nThe GM might make it obvious from the beginning that the \nnormal laws of direction do not apply here. He may also ask \nthe players in detail about what landmarks they are using and \ndirection of their heading, and then roll in secret on the table. \nNote that results which put the Battle-Brothers in the same area \nthey started out are valid, as it is quite possible for the twisted \nspace of the outer forge to lead one back to where he began.\nMission Consequence: If the Kill-team has the map from \nAllewis or some other reliable means of navigation, add +2 to \ntheir Location roll.\nAlternatively, the GM may wish to simply pick his favourite \nlocations from the list below. He can dictate these as the points \nencountered (either randomly or by following the map) on the \npath to the Irradial Forge.\nMag-rail huB\nThis receiving station has dozens of spokes for the magnetic \npropulsion cars that send and receive shipments to other forge \ndistricts. The cars also form an unreliable transport network \naround the massive forge itself. While taking the cars offers no \nmore guarantee of reaching one’s destination, it at least means \nthe passenger gets there quicker. Servitors perform most of \nthe loading and unloading here. They are unsophisticated \nmodels, neither equipped for combat nor programmed for \nadvanced reactions. They go through their ceaseless routines \ncompletely ignoring the Battle-Brothers.\nTable 3–4: Travel in the Outer Forge\nRollResultTime in TransitModifier to Next Roll\n1 or less\nThe Kill-team is hopelessly lost. They go nowhere, finally circling \nback to their previous location after hours of wandering.\n1d10+5 hours+0\n2\nThe Kill-team has trouble navigating the confusing outer forge, but \nfinally follows a rail line that leads them to the Mag-rail Hub. From \nthis central location, it may be slightly easier to progress.\n1d10 hours+1\n3\nAfter hours of marching, the Kill-team sees a wide clearing in the \ndense machine wilderness. They emerge at the Cyprium Mine.\n1d10+1 hours+0\n4\nIt takes several hours, but the Kill-team is beginning to get their \nbearings in this strange landscape.

Finally \nthey wander into the Magi Graveyard, where it seems no one else \nhas tread set foot in many years.\n1d10+1 hours+0\n6\nIt is difficult to say whether the Kill-team found the Whispering \nCogitators, or the Cogitators found them.

If the Kill-\nteam takes one for transport to their next Location, they may \nsubtract 2 hours from the time it takes them to reach it (to a \nminimum of 1 hour).\nCypriuM Mine\nThis active strip mine bores ever deeper into the damaged \nplanet, exploiting the meagre copper veins in this location. \nOnce the excavators might have been a more traditional design, \nwith crenulated scoops sifting through the rubble. Over time, \nthe Hadex Anomaly has entertained itself by touching the \noperation with its perverse nature. Crane arms hang empty like \ntrees whose rotten fruit has fallen. Their spiny metal offspring \nbustle and burrow within the rock, stripping it under their own \npower now. This evolution appears at least partially defensive. \nSeveral small trenches resonate with shrieking metal and \ncarapace; the spindly foragers fight an unending war with rust \ndecapods over the spoils of the mine. \nLike most of the outer forge, no living being oversees this \noperation. However, there may be an increased chance of \nencountering a patrol at the mine, due to its lack of cover.\nMagi graveyard\nNothing moves in this dead basin of pitted and weathered \nstatues. At first glance the creators and the creations may be \ndifficult to distinguish. The corpses of a dozen Magi stand \nhere. Their flesh has long rotted, leaving vaguely human-\nshaped frames of metal and bone. The labour that must have \nkilled them is a parody of man as well: metal constructs with \nleering faces and clockwork organs. Scorched wire and burst \npipes wreathe the artificial beings, providing the only hint \nas to what might have gone wrong. The environment and its \nmetal-hungry scavengers have worked their ruin on the site \nof this failed experiment. \nMap of the forge\nIf the characters have the map Allewis provided, it \nappears more like a warp navigation chart than any \nland map. It is marked not with distances and fixed \nobjects, but with currents, vectors, shifting landmarks, \nand tenuous equations. It suggests a region where \nspace and possibly even time are malleable. \n123\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nperpetual ManufaCtoruM\nUntil recently, this automated facility took raw ore into its \nhuge receptacles and produced intimidating needle injector \nassemblies. The manufactorum has either been forgotten or \nthe ore simply run dry, but the production lines continue their \nempty motions. Rumbling belts dump phantom materials \ninto cold smelting vats, and conveyors cycle empty moulds \nthrough cooling chambers. A pile of the facility’s last output \nrusts at the end of the line, forming a haphazard mountain \nof needles.\nEmpty tubes for the chemicals that accompanied these \ndevices line one wall. Each one bears a dusty but legible \nlabel and chymerical formula. A Routine (+20) Chem-Use \nTest identifies most of these as various poisons and corrosive \nagents. However, one is an anti-toxin even more potent than \nthat carried by Astartes power armour injectors. The label \nreads: “For inoculation against specimen 634-9.”\nthe whiSpering CogitatorS\nHere stands an artificial cliff, dozens of metres high. Its face is \nnot stone, but circuit and screen. Hundreds upon hundreds of \ncogitators blink in a dizzying pattern that is neither perfectly \nrandom nor mathematically predictable. The coloured \nluminator buds span every hue and shade in the spectrum, \noccasionally their flickering converges into the startlingly \nprecise image of a place or object. This machine’s purpose, \nand if it has any relevance to Missions present or future, is left \nentirely to the GM’s discretion.\nA simuloptera hive swirls nearby, mimicking the bright \nlights to perfection. The column shifts again, forming an \nimitation of one of the Battle-Brothers. His likeness walks \ntowards the cogitators and sweeps his hand along the panels \nin an exploratory gesture. Then the hive disappears as it \nbecomes one with the jagged ground.\nOPTIONAL ENcOUNTER: \nSERVITOR NURSERY\nThe Vinculum Proselytes are not particular about the inputs \nfor their combat servitors. The mutated and the untainted, the \ndead and the living—all become fodder for their mindless \nwarriors. This facility (which Rij supplies) in the outer forge is \nresponsible for the majority of combat servitors in the Irradial \nForge district. \nThe district’s obsession with the dark gods and their \npowers means that an unusual number of mutants, living and \ndead, are available to build upon. However, this number still \ndoes not approach the quantity needed to defend the forge’s \nmany holdings and launch their campaigns of conquest and \nexploration. Therefore, they add to the available number of \nmutants by altering healthy subjects. The facility’s largest room \nis devoted to this purpose, where living men are subjected to \nthe first steps of the mechanisation and mutation processes \nsimultaneously. Nimble surgical arms graft artificial muscle \nonto their frames as their blood is pumped full of repugnant \nchemicals. \nIf the Battle-Brothers enter the servitor nursery, the \npresiding Tech-priests do not number enough to be a threat. \nAs presented, the location does not include any noteworthy \ncombat. However, if your pacing calls for a fight, the mutated \nservitors produced here make an obvious choice of foe. Several \nhundred menials are currently held for transformation. Their \ndispositions are as follows:\n•Contained but unchanged: The most fortunate are simply \nlocked in a crowded room, awaiting processing. Aside \nfrom slight dehydration, they are unharmed.\n•Prepped for surgery: These menials are shut into a room not \ndissimilar from the first. However, preparatory chemicals \ncourse through their veins. If the Battle-Brothers open \nthis holding area, the menials interpret the hulking metal \nmen as their captors. They pour forth in a drug-induced \nfrenzy. Use the Imperial Sympathiser profile to form a \nHorde. The Battle-Brothers may attempt to use normal \nInteraction Tests to get through to the struggling menials, \nbut their chem fugue imposes a –10 penalty.\n•On the tables: These men and women are in the midst \nof horrific transformations. Their skin sports bleeding \nlesions and bubbling tumours. While still conscious and \nscreaming, their torsos and craniums are clamped open \nas the Tech-priests install the necessary components and \nremove extraneous fleshy organs.\n•Undergoing mindwipe and hypno-indoctrination: The \napostate Tech-priests save the mental cleansing until last. \nThey prefer to let the horrific procedures and floods of \nchemicals “soften up” the mind before working on it. The \nunfortunate menials at this stage are closer to servitors \nthan people.\nOPTIONAL ENcOUNTER: \nORBITAL BATTERY \ncONTROLS\nThe Thunder’s Word has not had an easy time above Samech \nsince the Battle-Brothers deployed. While the Kill-team \nmakes their way through the outer forge, they receive a \nbroken transmission from the frigate:\n“Kill-team, this is the Thunder’s Word. Our situation is \ngrave. We are taking heavy fire from plasma batteries near your \nlocation. If we are to remain, we need you to disable the local \norbital defence weaponry. Transmitting coordinates of control \nstation.”\nThe coordinates are only a few kilometres from the Kill-\nteam’s present location. Since the Thunder’s Word launched \nthe Battle-Brothers above this region of the planet, they \nare taking the most fire from the batteries controlled by the \nIrradial Forge. If the Battle-Brothers can put the weapons \nout of commission, they buy themselves and their allies   \nprecious time.\n124\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nThe control station is a tall metal scaffold with two \nenclosed platforms. It is neither heavily protected nor heavily \nfortified. Only four Skitarii man the meagre tower. The Kill-\nteam should have no trouble dispatching them and taking \npossession of the station. The console’s holo-projector shows \nthe badly damaged Thunder’s Word. It weaves in and out of \nthe system’s asteroid belt, trying to limit confrontations with \nthe overwhelming planetary fleet. As they examine the orbital \nbattery console, the Battle-Brothers see it can be used not \nonly the disable the plasma batteries above Samech, but to   \ndirect them.\nIf the Kill-team turns the Irradial Forge’s weapons on the \npursuing ships, they can significantly improve the Deathwatch \nvessel’s chances. Of course, this immediately alerts the Vinculum \nProselytes that the Kill-team occupies their control station. \nOne Battle-Brother is sufficient to fire the orbital batteries. His \nbrothers can work to defend and fortify their position, giving \nthem as long as possible to aid the Thunder’s Word.\nThis extended attack and defence could play out over several \nhours of narrative time. To avoid having to make hundreds of \nTests, represent this task in Strategic Rounds. Each Strategic \nRound represents about thirty minutes and every character has \none Strategic Turn in the Round to represent their actions over \nthat time period. Each Round is a higher level of abstraction, \nrepresenting more time and a greater number of smaller events \ndescribed by a single Test. Other than the amount of time per \nRound, the encounter follows normal Deathwatch rules. \nEach Strategic Round that passes, the Battle-Brother at the \nbattery controls can make one Ballistic Skill Test to represent \nhis defence of the Thunder’s Word. Assume each successful \nTest means one large enemy ship or one squadron of fighters \ndestroyed. The Battle-Brothers have one Strategic Round \nbefore the Irradial Forge responds. Those not firing can use \nthis time to prepare themselves and the tower. The GM should \nallow each character to describe what he is doing to prepare, \nand then Test on the most appropriate Skill or Attribute \nto gauge the effect his preparation has on the upcoming \ncombat. Several Tactics Skill Groups could be used. Other   \npossibilities include:\n• A Security Test to determine weak points in their   \ndefence strategy\n• A Tech-Use or Trade Test to craft a more   \ndefensible position\n• A Demolitions Test to mine the approach to the scaffold\nOn the second Strategic Round, the enemy begins to arrive. \nWithout any modification, the control station offers cover \nwith AP 10. The initial force is a group of  4 Skitarii led by \na Tribune. Every following Strategic Round, 4 more Skitarii \narrive. The Skitarii do not attempt to scale the tower until 12 \nSkitarii are present.\nIf the Battle-Brothers do an exceptional job of defending \ntheir position, the number of Skitarii amassing outside may \nnot be enough to rout them. In this event, the GM should \nbring the encounter to some sort of resolution before the pace \ndrags. He may declare that they have destroyed enough enemy \nships that the Thunder’s Word successfully withdrew to a more \ndefensible position in the asteroid belt, or have more serious \nreinforcements such as tanks and Obliterators start arriving.\nThe Kill-team should keep in mind that destroying Samech’s \nentire orbital fleet is an impossible task, and taking on the \nentire guardian army of the Irradial Forge is little easier. Their \ngoal should be to hold the control station as long as possible, \nnot indefinitely. As long as the Kill-team has a reasonable exit \nstrategy, let the combat wind down when they give up the \norbital battery controls and assume they withdraw safely.\nTHE FORGE’S IRON HEART\nLaridicus at last looked upon the castle of the daemons. The lands’ \nfoul hosts could not compare to the cruelty of the kings who reigned \nin that dark palace. You see, monsters will only follow beings even \nmore monstrous. Can you guess what manner of creature the daemons \nanswered to?\n–Excerpt from Laridicus and the Shadow Lands, an Eleusian \nchildren’s parable.\nThe Irradial Forge is just as vexing to navigate at its heart as \nit was in its outskirts. The forge has two levels. The upper \nworkshops house most of the senior members of the Vinculum \nProselytes and the equipment that supports them. The same \npatrols may be found on this level as in the outer forge. The \nlower level is where the apostates keep their most secret and \nterrible projects—including the thaumagramm diodes. No \none but the order’s most trusted and elite may cross the Iris \ninto the lower chamber.\nThere is only one way into the Forge, and it is guarded by \na unit of Samech Praetorians (see page 135). Their number \nshould be one less than the size of the Kill-team. The GM \nshould vary their weapon complement, with only one or two \ncarrying a lascannon or multi-melta. If the Battle-Brothers \nhave managed to conceal their presence until now, doing \nbattle outside the Forge’s gates certainly gives their presence \naway. Unless they somehow manage to decoy the entire sentry \nunit away, the time for subtlety is most likely over.\nthe power genatoriuM \n(upper level)\nThe central column of the upper forge is filled with the \ncacophonic din of clanging metal. Here, magnetic turbines \nchurn in Samech’s gravitic tides. Thick, wormlike cables lead \nfrom the generators into the walls. They writhe and buzz \nlike a cascade of gleaming maggots. The power genatorium \nwas not built to withstand attacks from within, although \neffectively demolishing it takes several minutes and is likely \nto draw the fleshless magi from their quarters (below). \nDestroying the generators powers down most of the upper \nlevel except the cogitator banks, and activates the sinister red   \nauxiliary lighting.\n125\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nMagoS quarterS (upper level)\nThe transformed magi reside on the upper level. They have \ncleansed their cells of furniture, dining facilities, and all the \nother accoutrements of the biological. They live a pure existence \nsurrounded only by machines and tomes of knowledge. The \nBattle-Brothers are unlikely to get far in this complex without \nencountering one of the fleshless residents. (See their profile on \npage 138.) An internal vox allows the first Magos encountered \nto call his brothers for reinforcement. The Magi number just \nunder a dozen, and arrive in staggered numbers after the start \nof conflict.\nOnce the Kill-team shows the lifeless abominations \nthat their existence is not as immortal as they’d hoped, the \nBattle-Brothers can proceed. Every chamber contains some \nform of proscribed lore. A great deal of it involves ways to   \ncheat death.\nDozens of technologies deemed heretical by the Adeptus \nMechanicus are spread throughout the documents in these \nquarters, and large collections on xenos, the warp, daemons, \nand more obscure arcana provide insight into the interests of \nthe different individuals. Magos Vayze keeps his residence in \nthis same area, although he is not present when the Battle-\nBrothers enter. His quarters are little different from the rest \nof his order’s, only slightly larger. They contain more of the \nobscene lore and several xenotech trinkets. However, his study \naltar holds another copy of the thaumagramm diode schematic \nfrom the caves on Aurum (see page 37). Moreover, his own \nmusings and research on the diodes can also be found there.\nthe iriS (upper level)\nThis segmented diaphragm connects the upper and lower \nlevels of the Forge. Only the Vinculum Proselytes and their \nallies are permitted to enter the lower level, where they \nsafeguard their most prized lore and technology. Magos \nVayze has implemented a lock more secure and unbreakable \nthan any crude key or code. The malign cogitators control \nthe Iris. Their daemonic inhabitants know who is permitted \nthrough the gateway, and who is not. Even the most powerful \nmelta bombs seem unable of scratching the surface of this \nmighty gate. Nothing short of a Titan’s grip is likely to open \nthe Iris with brute force. To cross into the lower level, the \nKill-team must find some way of bypassing the Iris. Their \noptions include: \n•Like most spirits of the warp bound to mortal masters, \nthe cogitators obey, but they have no love for the \nVinculum Proselytes. They may be persuaded, tricked, or \nthreatened into opening the Iris. (See below.)\n•Directly interfacing with the daemonic cogitators \nimperils the soul of any rash enough to attempt it. \nHowever, a Challenging (+0) Scrutiny Test by anyone \ntrained in Tech-Use notices an exposed patch of circuitry \nthat might be used to override the machines’ control. \nCreating this manual bypass requires a Challenging +0 \nTech-Use Test. However, that only keeps the cogitators \nfrom holding the Iris shut; it does not open it. Manually \nprying the hatch open still requires an Arduous (–40) \nStrength Test.\n•The lower level is not a warp-manipulated space. It is \nphysically connected to the upper level. Thus, it is \npossible to slowly melt through a more vulnerable point \nin the floor of the upper level to gain access, provided \nthe Kill-team has armaments that can penetrate the floor \nplates. Once an access way has been created, it is a 15 \nmetre drop between levels.\nThe Iris opens onto a spiralling set of stairs that descend \nto the lower level.\nCogitator BankS (upper level)\nIn the days when Samech was loyal to Mars, or at least better \nconcealed their treachery, the planet garnered much fame for \nits sophisticated cogitators. They did not stop researching \nor manufacturing these advanced machines when they were \ndeclared Apostates. The Irradial Forge simply began to \napply its principles of “improving” technology through warp \ninfusions to the cogitators. Over the centuries this culminated \nin cogitators that are both self-powered and self-aware. Of \ncourse, this was only achieved through the blasphemous \nand dangerous binding of lesser daemons into the circuitry, \nusing the same arts sorcerers must master in order to forge   \ndaemon weapons. \nBanks of these infernal machines ring the upper level. \nSome have speakers that hiss in many voices, while others \ncommunicate through symbols on their screens or print-\nouts. A successful Interaction Test (or a well-roleplayed ruse) \nconvinces the daemonic spirits to open the Iris for the Kill-\nteam. Once the portal is opened, there is nothing to stop \nthe Battle-Brothers from cleansing the tainted machines if   \nthey desire.\nMission Consequence: If the Kill-team earned the \ngratitude of Magos Quezalt and he provided an algorithm \npurifier, it can be used to safely interface with the cogitators. \nIn this case, forcing them to open the Iris requires a Difficult \n(–10) Tech-Use Test.\nFrom the Data-vault of Magos Vayze:\nAll attempts to research the devices \ndesignated ‘thaumagramm diode’ \n(Note: See cross reference file) \norigin have failed. 53 textual \nsources found for the diodes. 53 \nsources cross reference older \nevents. Earliest recording found: \nM36 on Corulsiem. Thaumagramm diodes \nused during civil war to control \n(detonate?) enemy weapons. These \naccounts refer to “unearthing” the \ndesigns. Conclusion: thaumagramm \ndiode origin earlier than Corulsiem.\nThe sorcerer’s vision is limited. \nNote: diviner. Limited vision. \nIrony? His scope is fixed to the warp \ngate.\nThe diodes can be applied to the \ncontrol and alteration of any \ntechnology. Priority test subject: \nAstrum Conflagro.\n126\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nWarded Shipping Crates\nSeveral sealed crates stand by one of the cogitator banks. \nShould these be opened, they hold racks of small stasis tubes. \nWithin each one is knife-sized sliver of wires and circuits \ntracing vile patterns. These processor spores need nothing \nexcept a power source to rapidly evolve into impressive \ncogitator banks. The void-proof containers suggest these \nspores were going to be shipped off world.\nxenoS penS (lower level)\nSamech is infamous for its experimentation labs, where its \nhungry knowledge seekers probe the physiologies of dozens \nof alien races. The Vinculum Proselytes are no exception \nto such proclivities. This dim chamber holds their current \nspecimens in force cages. The captive aliens include:\nA Tau Engineer\nFiu’Ui’ Len is a member of the Earth caste. Samech goes \nthrough members of his fragile species quickly. He has \nonly been captive a few weeks, but the effects of constant \nexploratory surgeries have obviously taken their toll on him. \nHe does not speak any form of Gothic, but he knows a Space \nMarine when he sees one. If they do not appear immediately \nhostile, the Tau does his best to pantomime a plea to free him. \nAfter all, death at their hands can be no worse than remaining \nin the Proselytes’ care.\nAn Ork\nThis green-skinned brute is in good health, and looks only \nslightly bored in his cage. He grins toothily when he sees the \nSpace Marines, and bangs his fists against his holding cell \nexpectantly. Judging from the bloodstains on the floor near \nhis cage, it appears he has had no lack of opportunity to do \nwhat Orks love best.\nA Grey Reptile\nThis quadrupedal creature has sharp, curved claws on all four \nlimbs. Its skin is dry and flaking; it seems only half aware of \nits surroundings. It does not react to the Kill-team when they \nenter the room. However, if they deactivate the force cage it \nsluggishly attempts an escape from the forge.\nAn Eldar\nOf all the xenos specimens, this Eldar Harlequin is \nunquestionably in the worst condition. Dahzak took great \npains to capture one of the enigmatic Harlequins. For years \nthe sorcerer has tried unsuccessfully to pry the secrets of the \nBlack Library and the webway from his captive. Unlike the \nother xenos prisoners, the Harlequin speaks human languages \nperfectly, although his lilting voice is raw. Read aloud or \nparaphrase the following:\nOne of the last cages holds the lithe body of an Eldar. His \nclothing is ragged and bloody; patches of faded colour flicker \nweakly across his dying holosuit. His slanted eyes open, and he \npulls himself to his feet—eerily graceful even in his broken state. \nHe looks directly at you. “It won’t be long until your sorcerer can \ncast his spell.” he beckons them closer.\nIf they approach, he continues:\n“It may be inevitable, whether by his doing or another’s. In the \nend your short-sighted race always warps what it manages to \nwrest from the universe. As long as the gate remains in human \nhands we tempt fate.”\nAn Ordinary (+10) Lore: Forbidden (Xenos) Test\nrecognises the Eldar as a Harlequin. His goal is simple: make \nsure the Space Marines stop Dahzak from breaching the \nwebway. However, he has no faith that the xenocidal warriors \nwould do this if they knew he wanted them to. Instead, he does \nhis best to lead them to making the conclusion themselves. \nEldar dealings with Mankind have always gone better if they \nkeep their true motivations secret. The Harlequin is clearly \nin no condition to fight. If the Space Marines condemn \nhim for the crime of his race, he makes no attempt to   \ndefend himself.\n127\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nConditional Encounter: Captive Venomthrope\nThe Xenos Pens also contains a captive from Hive Dagon on \nthe Orpheus Salient. This bulging monstrosity is a writhing \nmass of carapace, tentacles, and bloated sacs of toxins.\nMission Consequence: Dahzak foresaw that his enemies \nwould one day invade the Irradial Forge. However, divination \nis an imperfect art. He knew someone would come, but not \nwhen or who. In preparation he equipped this cage with a \npsy-activated trigger. If the Battle-Brothers did not ward \nthemselves, Dahzak can track their movements through the \nForge and unleashes the Venomthrope while they are in the \nXenos Pens. He does this at a time when the Battle-Brothers’ \nattention is not on the Venomthrope’s cage. However, they \ncan make a Difficult (–10) Awareness Test to hear the \ncontainment field power down. If the Battle-Brothers use the \nAnti-toxin found in the Perpetual Manufactorum (see page \n124) it allows them to treat the Venomthrope’s Toxic Miasma \nas the standard Toxic Trait instead. The high-ceilinged room \nis open, save for the force cages. Each of these provides cover \nwith AP 20. If a cage is destroyed, there is a 50% chance of \nfreeing the occupant and a 50% chance the occupant dies.\nOptional Encounter: A Fate worse Than Death\nNot all of Inquisitor Vincent’s Acolytes died on the archipelagos \nof Karlack. Unknown to the survivors, Judge Ellyn Veridos \nwas not killed with the rest of Vincent’s cadre. Instead, the \napostate Magi sent her to an even less merciful fate. One \norgan at a time, the Vinculum Proselytes have embedded the \nforeign material of a dozen alien species in the former Throne \nAgent. Read aloud or paraphrase the following:\nA dissection table sits in one corner. A patchwork of alien parts \nwith a human face lies upon it. The shape suggests a female, \nthough it is impossible to be sure. You can see her yellow heart \nbeating through her translucent skin.\nShe stirs under the scrutiny of the Battle-Brothers. The \nwoman is clearly beyond saving, but she does not accept death \ngracefully, weeping and pleading for her life until silenced.\nShe lifts one veined, miscoloured talon towards you. “Please, help \nme,” she croaks in a voice both wet and echoing. “I don’t want to \ndie. Help me.”\nSuppleMental generatorS \n(lower level)\nThe subterranean genatorium has little in common with its \ncounterpart above. This level of the forge used to be hidden, \na place for the Vinculum Proselytes to perform their research \nwhile Samech still professed loyalty to Mars. The supplemental \ngenerators are a remnant of that era. They supply the secret \nexperiments of the lower level with secure power that could \nnot be interrupted by any outside disaster. The generators \nare traditional fusion reactors, notable primarily for their \nmundane nature in this nest of the insane and heretical.\nthe Matrix of truth (lower level)\nThis foretelling device was the first collaboration between \nDahzak and Vayze. It aims to make logic from chaos and \nextract truth from lies. Its core is a shifting pool of harnessed \nimmaterium, carefully manipulated by Dahzak to reflect \npossible futures. A sphere of holo-recorders surround it, \ndetailing every image that appears on the mercurial surface. \nThe mechanical shell then relays these recordings to the data \nbank, where a predictive statistical formula weighs the possible \nlies and truths of the vision. By applying a probability filter \nto the fickle projections of Dahzak’s oraclular abilities, Magos \nVayze hopes to create a more sophisticated prognosticator \nthan science could ever accomplish alone. Read aloud or \nparaphrase the following:\nIf your eyes graze the surface of the rippling orb, they are at \nonce compelled and repulsed by its vexing images. Thousands of \nfragmented pictures of people and events float along its surface \nlike oil over water. The most horrifying and the most mundane \nsights appear in the orb, in the most probable and the most \nimpossible of circumstances. \nAnyone who looks into the Matrix must make a Challenging \n(+0) Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points. Below are \nsome examples of what any onlookers may witness. (This is \nalso a perfect opportunity for the GM to foreshadow events \nin his own campaign or plant his own misleading visions).\n•Deep in the heart of Watch Fortress Erioch, the final \nchamber of the Omega Vault opens. It is not one more \ncryptic clue or weapon that lies there. It is not the last \nline of defense against an alien threat. It is a dark, foul \nshadow that sweeps out into the unprepared Fortress. The \nfinest warriors of the Adeptus Astartes fall like helpless \nchildren before it, and Erioch runs red with blood.\n•The polluted sky over Karlack is something approaching \nblue today. As ever, the glittering black Cenotaph pierces \nharlequinS\nThe Harlequins are a faction of the Eldar far removed \nfrom normal craftworld life. These warrior troubadours’ \nbest understood purpose is to re-enact the fall of the \nEldar through song and dance and ensure that its \nlessons are never forgotten. It is also whispered that \nthey bear an enigmatic duty to guard the fabled Black \nLibrary—an ancient repository of knowledge in the \nheart of the webway. These performers wears masks \nand costumes even into battle, where they make use of \ntheir manipulative skills to deceive and destroy their \nenemies. Even fellow Eldar consider the Harlequins \naloof and strange.\n128\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nthe horizon like a sword. Other black shapes begin to \nappear against the sky. First one, then another of these \nmenacing alien shapes gather like storm clouds over the \nFortress World.\n•Row upon row of Imperial Guardsmen stand before the \nwhite tombs on Sepulchre Sigma. Their lips are blue; \ntheir skin is pale. Lord Commander Sebiascor Ebongrave \nstrolls through their ranks, eyes narrowed. He pauses \nto ask a question of one soldier. The Lord Commander \nappears not to like the answer. Smoothly he draws his \nsidearm and shoots the man in the head. He moves to the \nnext one and repeats his question.\ndahzak’S SanCtuM (lower level)\nThis stone chamber is the one part of the Forge practically \nempty of any technology. Dahzak has made his lair here \nbeneath the Irradial Forge for decades, slowly transforming \nthe room to something secure and to his liking. An obvious \nguardian artefact sits in the centre of the main room. Read \naloud or paraphrase the following:\nThe metre-high pyramid in the centre of the room is an obvious \nwarning to would-be intruders. A dimensional disturbance burns \nat the apex of the pyramid. The pulsing disc has the obvious \noutline of an eye, with a lid that flutters in mimicry of sleep. \nAn Ordinary (+10) Psyniscience Test confirms that the \neye is some form of conduit to the warp, although its relatively \nmuted signature suggests that the conduit is currently closed. If \nanyone enters the room, that changes dramatically. The guardian \ndevice can attack with a Bolt of Change (see Dahzak’s profile) \nas though it were a sorcerer with Psy Rating 3. Anyone struck \nby the bolt can feel the raw forces of alteration pulling at their \nflesh even if they pass the Toughness Test.\nThe guardian device is not indestructible, but damaging it \n(or moving it) requires weapons beyond the scale that the Kill-\nteam can carry personally. Fortunately its artificers placed too \nmuch faith in their work, and left no possibility that one blast \nfrom the warp eye would not be enough. It fires at each Battle-\nBrother only once before going dormant.\nThe sanctum holds literally dozens of proscribed artefacts \nranging from xenotech field projectors to misshapen hunks of \ncoral covered in devotions to the dark gods. The tomes and \nscrolls are equally dangerous and blasphemous, exceeding \nthe sum of everything found in the Magos Quarters. The \nBattle-Brothers stand amidst the result of hundreds of years \nin pursuit of knowledge about all the things the Imperium \ntries to suppress. One item does stand out amidst the others. A \nsmall glass sphere holds a miniature floating sword. The device \nis half of a locus seeker (see page 175 of the \nDeathwatch\nRulebook). As with all seekers, they only way to know exactly \nwhere or how far the artefact points is to follow it to its other \npart. It appears Dahzak is preparing to do just that. The small \ndevice sits beside an open stellar map with several experimental \nvectors drawn radiating out from Samech.\nConditional enCounter: \nCulling the paCk \nArcus Dyre and Magos Vayze have a long and bitter history. \nIf Vayze realises the psyker is free of the Soul Alembic, he \nmay leave the Forge to deal with his old nemesis personally. \nThis presents the Kill-team with the opportunity to spot the \nMagos alone in the halls of the lower level as he departs. \nThey may choose to dispatch him (hopefully quietly) or to \nsimply let him leave and deal with him later. In the latter case \nthe GM should decide the outcome of the NPC’s showdown \noff screen.\nMission Consequence: The Battle-Brothers only have \nthis opportunity if they chose to rescue and ally with Arcus \nDyre. He returns the enmity of the Magos, and may suggest \nthat they let him deal with Vayze.\nthe guardian Barrier \n(lower level)\nIn times past this room held daemons and other entities \nenslaved to the will of the Forge’s masters. The barrier of \nrunes in the floor kept these guardians at bay. At present no \nsuch creatures are in evidence. Even without a denizen to \nhold captive, the runs provide a safeguard for the rest of the \nForge should something go awry in the Diode Chamber.\narCanoteCh workShop \nanteChaMBer (lower level)\nFor years this workshop was the site of Vayze and Dahzak’s \ncollaboration, where all manner of experiments have succeeded \nand failed. The accoutrements of technology and sorcery \nsit side by side here. A data-slate lies inside a summoning \ncircle. The embalmed bodies of two naked humans hold a \nvox between them. The alchemical cabinet contains pouches \nof sulphur and vials of machine oil and thick unguents that \nresemble those from tech-rites, except they flicker with \nunnatural light.\nThe workshop also contains active Praetorian servitors \nguarding the next set of doors; their number is equal to that \nof the Battle-Brothers. If Magos Vayze is still present in the \nForge, he is at the head of this force. The Vinculum Proselytes \nattack. Pitched combat in this relatively small room is likely \nto result in many broken artefacts, documents set alight, and \nany other peripheral specifics the GM wishes to invent. The \nheavy doors between the antechamber and the main Diode \nchamber are sealed. Opening them requires a Challenging \n(+0) Security Test or strong explosives. This would only be \na minor obstacle if the Kill-team didn’t also have to contend \nwith the Praetorians. Furthermore, Dahzak’s farseeing abilities \nallow him to direct his psychic powers that require line of \nsight at the Battle-Brothers from behind the closed doors.\nMission Consequence: If the Kill-team is warded against \nDahzak’s sorcerous sight, then he cannot see them through \nthe doors and thus cannot affect them with his sorcery until \nthey enter the Diode Chamber.\n129\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nthe diode ChaMBer (lower level)\nWhen the Battle-Brothers open the final doors, read aloud or \nparaphrase the following:\nYou have no trouble locating what you came here for. \nThaumagramm diodes cover the wall in front of you, climbing it \nfrom floor to ceiling and fanning out to the sides in sickly orange \nwings. The entire crescent-shaped room dances with electricity \narcing from the diodes. Their evil will is like a tangible force \npressing on your chest and eyes. The array of diodes dims and \nbrightens slowly. You think you can hear that malicious heartbeat \nin your ears.\nDahzak is ready for the Battle-Brothers. Being far from a \nfool, he has pulled back to one of the tips of the room and \nactivated Possibility Shield and/or Force Dome. Throughout \nthis combat, Dahzak has at least one of these defensive \npowers sustained, lowering his effective Psy Rating per the \nrules for sustaining multiple psychic powers on page 186 of \nthe \nDeathwatchRulebook. He surveys the Kill-team for \na moment.\n“You have come quite far to trouble my plans. How very typical \nof the Deathwatch, to throw yourselves into the jaws of hell even \nwhen you know that maw will devour you. Still, I can make use \nof your gene-seed after I tear it from your chests.”\nWhile he is an impressive sorcerer, Dahzak is truly deadly \nwith the thaumagramm diodes at his command. Being in the \nchamber has the following effects:\n•As a Half Action, Dahzak can infuse the inactive and \nbroken praetorians behind the Battle-Brothers with \nenergy from the diodes, allowing them to rise again. \nWhile so transfigured, the praetorians’ eyes glow with \nsickly orange light, and the same energy crackles around \ntheir melee weapons. Use their original profile with the \nfollowing modifications: Increase Toughness by +10; \nIncrease melee Damage by +2; Halve Wounds total. \nDahzak may only do this once, and only on a number \nof praetorians equal to half their original number (round \ndown). He performs this resurrection on the first Round \nhe can see the praetorians’ bodies.\n•Dahzak can channel the corrupting power of the \nthaumagramm diodes into the technology around him. \nThe bearer of any machine so affected must pass a \nChallenging (+0) Willpower Test to assert his control \nover the machine spirit. Resistance (Psychic Powers) \napplies to this Test. If he succeeds, there is no effect. If \nhe fails, roll 1d10 on Table 3–5: Thaumagramm Diode \nEffects. The bearer can make a new Willpower Test \neach Turn to try and regain control. Dahzak may use \nthis ability on one item per Round as a Free Action, or \n1d5+1 items as a Full Action.\nIf the Kill-team opened the doors with enemies still alive \nin the antechamber, then they must contend with those \nremnants as well.\nMission Consequences: If the Battle-Brothers found the \nthaumagramm diode schematic on Aurum and studied it, they \ngain a +10 to their Willpower rolls against the diodes.\nDahzak’s connection to the thaumagramm diodes has \nunforeseen and catastrophic effects when he expires. Rather \nthan calming, the putrid orange energies intensify. Any \nresurrected servitors explode, and huge glowing arcs of the \ncorrupting power shoot out from the diode array into the \nlower level of the forge.\nTable 3–5: Thaumagramm Diode Effects \nRollResult\n1\nBeing bathed in the foul energies of the thaumagramm diodes is far from pleasant, but it appears to have no effect on the \nBattle-Brother’s equipment.\n2The armour or weapon glows red-hot for a moment, and then erupts into sickly orange flames. (Treat this as being on Fire.) \n3\nThe thaumagramm diodes momentarily sway the armour or weapon’s machine spirit. Its surface twists into horrific visages \nthat speak blasphemies. Treat the item as having Fear (3), which also impacts the wearer.\n4The armour or weapon is paralysed by the surging energy. power armour freezes; weapons do not fire.\n5\nThe armour or weapon resists the taint but becomes moody and sluggish after the great effort. It performs as though in a \nHaywire Field result of Major Disruption. \n6\nThe armour or weapon becomes so contaminated and dangerous that the bearer must rid himself of it, at least momentarily—\nlest he be infected next. The bearer drops weapons or begins immediately trying to remove affected power armour. If the \ncontaminated item is power armour, the bearer may do nothing except remove it. \n7\nThe energy bites into the armour or weapon, damaging it. Weapons become unusable until repaired. The effect on power \narmour is purely cosmetic. \n8\nThe armour or weapon emits daemonic howls and shrieks. This has no statistical effect but is unsettling, particularly to \nTechmarines.\n9\nWarp energies infuse the item. It radiates an unstable aura. Any psychic power used within 20 metres treats its PR and chance \nof psychic phenomena as though it was Pushed. (However, the psyker does not take a level of Fatigue.)\n0\nThe armour or weapon turns on its bearer. Power armour attempts to crush the person inside; weapons overheat or jam \nexplosively. The bearer takes 1d10+5 Damage, ignoring AP but not TB.\n130\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nEScAPING THE \ncORRUPTED FORGE\nAs the Battle-Brothers leave the diode chamber, read aloud or \nparaphrase the following:\nThe Forge outside is madness. The orange lightning chains \nthrough the technologically rich environment. You hear screams \nand howls down the corridors that have no explicable source. \nDahzak’s last act of infamy unleashes every peril that the \nVinculum Proselytes have intentionally and unwittingly \nstocked in the Irradial Forge. The storm of warp energies \ninterferes with the Kill-team’s teleport beacons, as evidenced \nby their amber indicator runes. They must clear the Iris before \nthe Thunder’s Word can retrieve them. Their vox systems are \nlikewise useless, meaning they must remove their helmets to \ncommunicate verbally with one another. One of the many \neffects triggered by the destruction of the diodes is the \nopening of the warp eye in Dahzak’s sanctum. Therefore the \nKill-team could encounter nearly any menace as they try to \nwithdraw. Possibilities include:\n•The Matrix of Truth is free of its binding. The chaotic \nsphere whirls through the lower complex, howling as the \nlogic bindings slowly break. It assaults the minds of all it \nnears with its double-edged prophecies.\n•The warp puncture in Dahzak’s sanctum rips open into \na full breach, unleashing all manner of horrors into the \nIrradial Forge. At the simplest, the GM can represent the \nresults by adding a Mark of Chaos to one or more of \nthe adversary types in the forge. At the most extreme, \nterrible daemons burst through from the warp. (See the \nAdversaries section of the Deathwatch Rulebook.)\n•If the Venomthrope remained caged previously, the \nmaelstrom releases it. It roams the halls preying on any \nliving being it encounters.\n•In one of their many expeditions for specimens and \ntechnology, the Vinculum Proselytes captured a Tau Crisis \nBattlesuit. The polluted energy of the thaumagramm \ndiodes transforms it into a rampaging metal beast.\nIt is up to the GM whether destroying the thaumagramm \ndiodes ends the ill effects on the Kill-team’s gear, or if the \narcing energies intensify it. He should make it clear that \nthe danger in the lower level is only escalating with each \npassing moment. The Battle-Brothers could easily get caught \nup in combating the multitude of foes that suddenly emerge. \nHowever, a battle against an open warp breach is not one they \ncan win. Their Objective is complete. The effects of the diode \nmeltdown are meant to increase the drama of the climax, \nnot drag the players into hours more combat. If a particular \nenemy is preventing the Kill-team from exiting in a timely \nmanner, remember the new dangers can harm each other as \nwell as the Battle-Brothers.\nNO REST FOR THE wEARY\nThe Thunder’s Word fares little better than the Irradial Forge. \nWhen they are at last extracted, read aloud or paraphrase   \nthe following:\nThe Thunder’s Word trembles beneath your feet. The lights \nflicker and you can hear several warning klaxons above the \nbooming barrage of impacts on the hull. The ship shudders as the \nplasma drives flare to full thrust. Only moments later you feel the \nsinking sensation of translating into the warp.\nInjured but victorious, the Kill-team and the Thunder’s \nWord put the Iron Pit behind them.\nheroiC SaCrifiCe\nIf it hasn’t happened already, this is certainly a key \nmoment during which one of your players may ask \nabout the Heroic Sacrifice rules in the Combat Chapter \nof the DeathwatchRulebook. If a Battle-Brother \nchooses to sell his life in such a way (or perhaps throw \nhimself at certain doom and survive anyway if he still \nhas Fate Points), the event will be most memorable if \nthe player and the GM collaborate to create the most \ndramatic circumstances. Some possible scenarios in \nthis fight for fearless heroics include:\n•Shedding his armour and weapons as they betray \nhim to attack the sorcerer bare-handed, the \nBattle-Brother grapples Dahzak into the wall of \nthaumagramm diodes and they are both consumed \nin a blast of orange lightning and flames.\n•The Battle-Brother sees the warp energies welling \nfrom the thaumagramm diodes as the Chaos \nsorcerer dies. He throws himself atop the altar of \ncrystals, and cancels out the foul shockwave with \nthe strength of his soul and the purity of the wards \non his armour. His power armour is warped; his \nbody singed and blackened, but he has saved his \nbrothers from the hell about to be unleashed below \nthe Forge.\n131\n\nIII \n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nAftershocks \non Erioch\nT\nhe knowledge of how close the Jericho Reach came to \nanother Age of Shadow weighs deeply on those who \nknow about the Mission. Even if the Kill-team did \nsucceed in the Primary Objectives, several of the Secondary \nObjectives deal with preventing history from repeating \nitself. If they failed to accomplish any of these objectives, \nthe Deathwatch may find themselves facing other sabotage \nattempts or an antisonate-plated raider able to strike deep \nbehind the Iron Collar at will.\na threat averted\nAfter the Battle-Brothers have had time to rest and debrief, \nthe Chamber of Vigilance reconvenes. The Kill-team has \nsaved the Crusade from being crushed beneath a tide of \ndaemons. Even among the critical duties of the Deathwatch, \nthis is a laudable victory, and the Chamber honours it with \na short ceremony and the awarding of a heroic Distinction. \nBe sure to give the characters closure via an opportunity for \nfollow up roleplay with anyone who opposed their bid to \ndeploy to Samech.\nrewardS\nTable 3–6 Mission Experience Rewards shows the value of \ncompleting each of the Objectives if you award experience \nusing the detailed mission-based method. Furthermore, make \nan estimation of how much collateral damage the Kill-team \ncaused to the forge and award between 50 and 200 XP based \non the amount of destruction caused.\nEvery Battle-Brother who completes the Mission gains 1 \nFate Point.\nThe following are worth 1 Renown each:\n•Freeing the Titan from its existence as an enemy trophy\n•Destroying the Ruin Bringer\n•Doing massive damage to the forces of Samech\n•Inciting the menials of the Irradial Forge slums to rebel\n• Holding the orbital control station long enough to \ndefend the Thunder’s Word\n• Defeating the Obliterators\n• Defeating Dahzak is worth 2 Renown\nThe GM should reference page 270 in the Deathwatch \nRulebook to see if the Kill-team qualifies for additional \nRenown for completing multiple Objectives. As always, \nhe should also feel free to further reward clever plans and   \ngood roleplaying. \nTHE UNENDING wATcH\nThe threat from Dahzak and the Vinculum Proselytes may \nhave been averted, but the Deathwatch’s vigil is ceaseless. \nHow many crates of tainted processor spores already made \ntheir way off Samech before the Battle-Brothers discovered \nthem? What does the locus seeker from Dahzak’s sanctum \npoint at? Which visions in the Matrix of Truth were shadows \nof the future, and which were lies? \nvindiCator of the iron pit\nThe twisted nightmare forge of Samech leaves its mark. \nMany men have lost their sanity when exposed to the \ndepravity of the Charon Stars. However, in the case of \na Space Marine, it may serve to harden his courage and \nresolve. He has faced the horrifying machines of the \nenemy and emerged victorious.\nAfter the award ceremony, any character who \nsurvived the final Mission may purchase the Distinction \n“Vindicator of the Iron Pit” for 1000 Experience Points. \nFrom this point forward, the Battle-Brother halves any \nInsanity Points received (round down) and is completely \nimmune to the effects of Fear. He also gains the Skill \nLore: Forbidden (Archeotech). Further information on \nDistinctions and how to create your own can be found \nin future Deathwatch supplements.\nTable 3–6: Mission Experience Rewards\nObjectiveExperience Awarded\nStopping the assault on the warp gate400 XP\nPreventing the forces of Chaos from making more diodes to try again later250 XP\nDestroying the Ruin Bringer200 XP\nDefeating Dahzak200 XP\nDestroying the Paragelle150 XP\nRescuing the Imperial Sympathisers100 XP\nDestroying the Defiler Foundry100 XP\nDestroying the Servitor Nursery75 XP\nDefeating Sethahar100 XP\nIdentifying the trade in tainted cogitators100 XP\n132\n\nIII\n:\n The Vigilant Sword\nAppendix: NPCs\narCuS dyre\nOn Imperially-held planets Dyre’s prodigious power might \nhave been put to use for Mankind’s benefit.
