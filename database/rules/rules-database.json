Having proved himself to the\nknightly order that defended the peoples of Caliban from the Chaos beasts of the dark forests, Jonson quickly\nrose to power and led a crusade to slay the beasts and deliver the people of Caliban from their evil.\nThe Lion was said to have been temperamental and taciturn, but a brilliant strategist and unstoppable once decided\nupon a course of action. These qualities served him well when he reunited with the Emperor and led the Dark\nAngels Legion in the Great Crusade. One of the great tragedies of the Horus Heresy is that while Jonson earned\nglory amongst the stars, Luther, his closest friend and trusted second in command, turned against him, leading\nthose Space Marines who remained on Caliban to the service of Chaos. Returning to Caliban, Jonson discovered\nhis blood-brother’s treachery. So terrible was his vengeance, so bitter his sense of betrayal, that the ensuing battle\nsaw the destruction of Caliban itself.

While a regular, ‘Codex’ Chapter is organised so as\nto be highly mobile and flexible, and to be deployed almost anywhere in the galaxy on short notice, the\nDeathwatch often focuses on one threat, in one region. This means that a Watch Commander is able to\ntailor his forces to the task at hand. Some Watch Fortresses stand guard over vast Ork empires, ever ready\nto oppose the nigh-unstoppable invasions they periodically unleash. Others guard against more shadowy\nthreats, far harder to detect yet every bit as dangerous. Still more face a myriad of foes and must constantly\nadapt to an ever-changing strategic situation.\nThe Deathwatch has access to all of the specialised war machines used by other Chapters, and more. Even\nif a Watch Fortress makes no regular use of such equipment, it keeps mothballed stocks of everything from\nattack bikes to strike cruisers, for use as and when required.\nIn structure, the Deathwatch does not adhere to the strict organisation of squads and companies that the Codex\nAstartes dictates. The only relevant tactical unit is the Kill-team, which may be organised and equipped in any\nway the Watch Captains deem appropriate. In one mission the team may go to war on Space Marine bikes, and in\nthe next mounted on a mighty Land Raider.
