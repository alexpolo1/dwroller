           As I said earlier, a few years ago a small group of people at
           Games Workshop began to think seriously about how we
           might actually publish a 40K roleplaying game. There was, if
           I recall, much excitement and quite a few proposals as to how
           we might approach such a venture. Broadly speaking these
           proposals fell into one of two camps. On the one side was the
           opinion that because Space Marines were so powerful in the
           setting it made no sense to have them being featured alongside
           other characters at low levels of play and that therefore
           including them at all would simply unbalance the game. On
           the other side was the opinion that a 40K game without
           Space Marines was just unthinkable and that the game would
           have little interest if they were left out. So did we publish a

uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his
soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the
Space Marines, bio-engineered super-
warriors. Their comrades in arms
are legion: the Imperial Guard and
countless planetary defence forces, the
ever-vigilant Inquisition and the Tech-
Priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus,
to name but a few. But for all their
multitudes, they are barely enough to
hold off the ever-present threat from
aliens, heretics, mutants—and worse.

                        eathwatch is a roleplaying game that uses ten-sided
                        polyhedral dice for its core game mechanic. These
                        dice can be purchased from any game store, many
               bookstores, and are probably available from the same place
               this book was purchased. Each player and the GM will
               need access to at least two ten-sided dice, preferably of two
               different colours.
Introduction




                  In the game rules, one ten-sided die is referred to as “1d10,”
               while two ten-sided dice are referred to as “2d10,” and so
               forth. Deathwatch also often requires players to generate a
               random number from 1–100. This is known as a percentage
               roll and is often abbreviated as “d%” or “1d100.”
                  To make a percentage roll, use two ten-sided dice and
               assign one of them to the “tens” digit of the result and the
               other to the “ones” digit. Using differently coloured dice
               is helpful for distinguishing between these results. See also
               Table A–1: Percentage Roll Examples, below.
                  It is important to note that when rules say 2d10, this is
               not the same thing as a percentage roll. When rolling 2d10
               (or larger groups, such as 3d10, etc.), simply add the results
               of each die.


               eXample
               Atreus, a Space Marine of the Dark Angels Chapter, is struck by a
               frag grenade which inflicts 2d10 explosive Damage. The GM rolls
               two ten-sided dice, resulting in a 9 on one die and a 7 on the other.
               These results are added together for a total of 16 points of Damage.    what you need to

seem petty and restrictive, hardly worthy of the great mind
of a Primarch. Others describe actual battles together with
comments on the tactics employed and the decisions of the
commanders of the day. As such, the Codex Astartes is revered
as a holy text, and many Chapters regard its recommendations
as sanctified by the Emperor himself.

The Chapters that rigidly follow the word of the Codex
Astartes are sometimes referred to as Codex Chapters. These
Space Marines adhere to the codex as the model for their
organisation, identification markings and tactical doctrine. Of
all of the Codex Chapters, the most famous is the Ultramarines,
the Chapter of Roboute Guilliman himself. Most Chapters,
however, do not adhere so rigidly to the Codex patterns laid
down for organisation, tactical roles, or other processes. Many
Chapters are organised largely according to the Codex, but
are further shaped by their home world and the personality
of their Primarch. The Blood Angels and Dark Angels are
prime examples of this. A small number of Chapters are vastly
different from the Codex, and owe little or nothing to it at
all. The most famous of these ‘wild’ Chapters are the Space
Wolves, whose strong-willed Primarch Leman Russ moulded
his Chapter very much in his own image irrespective of
other influences.

Chapter’s masters, leading their fellows into the blood and
fury of battle.
    The first step along the path to becoming a mighty hero
of the Chapter is service in one of the Scout squads of the
Tenth Company. Scout squads consist of a Space Marine
Sergeant and four to nine Scouts. The role of the Sergeant
is to train the Scouts and lead them in battle. Only Sergeants
of considerable experience and status are designated for this
role. Scouts attend to every word their Sergeant utters, for it is
said that he has forgotten more of war than many more senior
officers will ever learn.
    Whilst serving as a Scout, a Neophyte learns the most
subtle arts of war. In a range of infiltration and reconnaissance
missions, he learns how to approach and observe the enemy.
Information gathered in such missions is passed back to the
main battle force. The Scouts get their first taste of combat
by way of carefully placed ambushes, the Scout Sergeant
drawing on centuries of experience to deploy his charges in
such a manner as to teach them as valuable a lesson as the
enemy. Unlike that enemy, the Scouts learn valuable skills in
such combats—the enemy earns nothing more than a quick
death, for even a Neophyte Space Marine is a puissant warrior
compared to a mortal man.
    A Space Marine serving in a Devastator squad may only
recently have completed his service in the Tenth Company
and been initiated as a Space Marine. It will be his first

                        and heresy.
                            However, all of that was just the beginning. In the
                        Deathwatch, the true horrors that seethe and gibber and
                        hunger to devour the soul of Mankind await you. Only the

                        of the Emperor prevail.
                              Serving the Deathwatch, you will face untold enemies.
                        Some you have already met in battle and defeated many times

                        Other vile xenos must also be faced, creatures not yet named in

                        the Imperium, and you must face perhaps the most terrible
                        of enemies—the Traitor Legions, your own kin who turned
                        against the Emperor at the very dawn of the Age of Imperium.
                              To enter the Deathwatch is to take the most binding of
                        oaths. Of what you see, what you kill, you may never tell,
                        except to those who you fight alongside. Your victories will go
                        unheralded, your deeds unknown, and your name unrecorded
                        save in the sealed archives of the mysterious Ordo Xenos. But
                        the Deathwatch crave not glory; they desire only to serve, and

Ross is playing a Dark Angel Space Marine with the Gregarious
Demeanour. Ross invokes his Gregarious Demeanour to give him a
+20 bonus to a Charm Skill Test when discussing tactics with the
Lord Governor of Platea, and convinces the Lord Governor not to
commit his forces foolishly.


s
In addition, the benefits of triggering or overcoming the
Demeanour may be enhanced if the Space Marine player puts
effort into roleplaying the Demeanour. The player can portray
his character either gaining strength from the ideals of his
Demeanour or (alternately) considering the demeanour as a
particular challenge to be overcome. If the Space Marine player
roleplays his Demeanour well, he can gain an Improvement. An
Improvement is a doubling of any applicable bonus (gaining a
+20 bonus to a Test instead of +10, removing 2d5 Damage
instead of 1d5, and so forth). For removing Fatigue, an
Improvement removes all current levels of Fatigue.
   A Space Marine Triggering his Demeanour can add an
Improvement if the other Space Marine players agree that the
Demeanour has been roleplayed well. This bonus is meant to
reward additional effort on the Space Marine player’s part and
the appreciation of his efforts by the other Battle-Brothers in
his kill-team. A simple method to judge this is to simply ask for
the opinion of the other Space Marine players at the table after


   DeSigner’S note: triggering a DeMeanour
   The intention behind a Space Marine’s Demeanour is to provide an opportunity for the Space Marine to gain a dramatic
   and highly memorable moment (a “divine moment of blessed fury”) once per game. The opportunity provided by the
   Demeanour is inextricably linked to the Space Marine’s Chapter and his own unique strength of personality—it is his
   chance to put the spotlight on just how his Chapter is different from those of his Kill-team Battle-Brothers, or (just as
   significant) how that particular Space Marine’s personality is expressed. It is recommended to the GM that triggering a
   Demeanour should always have something extremely impressive occur in-game, even if the Space Marine player’s dice
   utterly desert him. A Triggered Demeanour that results in an attack that hits and fails to do damage, for example, could
   still knock down the enemy—or (should the enemy escape) leave him with a distinctive scar that he will bear forevermore.
   It is left to the GM’s discretion for the exact effects of this, but it should be suitably epic and reward the Space Marine for
   roleplaying his Demeanour.

   Some players may be used to having the Game Master keep track of a character’s particular strengths and weaknesses.
   However, Game Masters have lots to do during a game. The GM manages the story, the pacing, the NPC’s, the challenges,
   and describes the action. It is very easy for a GM to forget an additional detail for each character whilst handling all the
   other myriad aspects of his job. In addition, the player has his Demeanours listed prominently on his own character sheet
   and is far more aware of the effects that the events in the game are having on his character than anyone else. Therefore,
   if Demeanours are meant to come into play regularly during the game, it would be good to place them into the player’s
   hands. Lastly, Deathwatch is at its best when the players themselves shape the course of the experience, from Cohesion
   to the Mission structure to the choice of Kill-team Leader. The reasons listed above are why the decision was made to
   make Triggering Demeanours a choice that is firmly under the player’s control.

                           The most important information for players of Dark heresy and rogue traDer is that Deathwatch uses the same
                           core mechanics and takes place in the same universe. There are some theme-related differences in the rules between these
                           games, but Dark heresy and rogue traDer players should feel right at home with the way the game itself works.
                              It is important to note that Deathwatch Space Marines are quite powerful (particularly in combat!) in relation to
                           Dark heresy and rogue traDer characters. A rogue traDer character with 14,000 xp is roughly equivalent to a
                           Rank 1 Deathwatch Space Marine (in that the Rogue Trader has a great deal of power tied up in his wealth and personal
                           starship!), and a Dark heresy character using an Ascended Career from ascension with 14,000 xp is also roughly equal
                           (having his own strengths in regards to Influence, many knowledge and investigative skills, and so forth). It is strongly
                           recommended that the GM consider carefully before mixing Space Marines into Dark heresy and rogue traDer
                           campaigns, because the Space Marine’s combat abilities are significantly higher than any other type of character.
                              Dark heresy characters using ascension are particularly recommended if you wish to combine the two games. An
                           Ordo Xenos Inquisitor and his trusted Throne Agents are quite appropriate to accompany a Deathwatch Space Marine
                           (or even an entire Kill-team) on a mission, or set of missions, of particular import.
                           y

                           It is assumed that, in Deathwatch, characters from other Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay games have some special
                           dispensation to accompany the Space Marines on their missions (for instance, if one of the player characters is an
                           Inquisitor). Throne Gelt and a Rogue Trader’s Profit Factor have no meaning for the Deathwatch. Therefore, the other
                           characters also benefit from the Requisition rules and may acquire Renown at the GM’s discretion (see pages 138–141
                           for more information about Requisition and Renown).
                               If a Deathwatch character joins a Dark heresy or rogue traDer game, the GM is encouraged to determine a
                           fair method of applying Requisition to the Space Marine character rather than participating in Profit Factor, Influence,
                           or Throne Gelt (all of these terms are explained in rogue traDer, ascension, and Dark heresy, respectively). Space
                           Marines themselves generally do not use money!

        oleplaying as a Space Marine presents a unique challenge:
        Space Marines are more than human, larger-than-life
        figures more akin to the heroes of the Trojan War and
the Odyssey than to Inquisitional Acolytes or a Rogue Trader and
his companions. Some Space Marines are epic beings who will
duel for days over a matter of honour, others are philosophers
and tragic figures, full of passion and regret. In their heart, many
Space Marines feel that their Chapter is just a little bit better
than the others. However you choose to interpret these ideas,
it is important to note that the Space Marines chosen for the
Deathwatch are nuanced, complex characters.
    This section presents some ideas and thoughts to keep in mind
when roleplaying your Deathwatch Space Marine, a guide that
should give you some great dramatic hooks and opportunities to
develop your character in a unique way.

DeSigner’S note: SquaD MoDe, Solo MoDe, anD CoheSion
You may notice many references to some particular game mechanics for Space Marines named Squad Mode, Solo Mode,
or Cohesion. These rules are discussed in detail in Chapter VIII: Playing the Game, but here’s a brief summary so you
have an idea of what they encompass.
   Because the Space Marines of the Deathwatch are drawn from Chapters across the Galaxy, they are not as comfortable
working together as with the Battle-Brothers of their home Chapters. Some Space Marines may find themselves serving
alongside rivals or even enemies, and overcoming those differences can be quite challenging.
    olo Mode represents a Deathwatch Space Marine in his natural state soon after arriving at Watch Fortress Erioch.
In Solo Mode, the Space Marine’s particular special abilities, beliefs, and traditions that are part of his home Chapter
are emphasised. He is relying on his instincts and the decades or even centuries of experience fighting alongside other
Battle-Brothers of his home Chapter. A Space Marine is never more an exemplar of what it means to be a battle brother
of his Chapter than when he is in Solo Mode.
    quad Mode is a way of representing a Kill-team that has set aside their differences and are focusing on working
together as a team. In Squad Mode, the Space Marines are not as focused on their individual Chapter abilities, instead
gaining the benefits of teamwork and being able to act as a unit. When Space Marines are in Squad Mode, they are a
nearly-unstoppable unit of deadly warriors.
   When a Kill-team is in Squad Mode, they have access to a resource known as Cohesion. Cohesion may be spent to
trigger certain effects and abilities that benefit the group and allow the Kill-team to perform incredible feats.
   You can find more detailed game information about these terms on page 219 (for Squad Mode), page 215 (for Solo
Mode) and page 211 (for Cohesion).
putting the “teaM” into “kill-teaM”
The purpose of Solo Mode and Squad Mode abilities being separate things is to provide an in-game mechanic to
support the overall concept of a group of individuals who slowly become a team. A Deathwatch Kill-team may contain
a Blood Angel, Space Wolf, and an Ultramarine—each of whom has his own special abilities, skills, and benefits from
his Chapter—but the Kill-team itself is greater than the sum of its parts. The Deathwatch RPG is about the process of
disparate individuals becoming a group that works together—in fact, there are some threats are simply so dangerous
that they can only be overcome by an experienced Kill-team combining their efforts.

 The primarch of the Blood Angels Legion, Sanguinius was a radiant warrior said to have been born aloft upon
 angelic pinions. His countenance was noble and pure and he wore perfectly sculpted armour of shining gold.
 Sanguinius was said to have been blessed with the gift, or burden, of prophecy. He was in many ways the
 most beloved of the Emperor’s sons, the uncounted multitudes singing his praises with every victory he laid
 before his father. Sanguinius was possessed of an abiding sense of justice, devoting his life to bringing about
 the utopia the Emperor proclaimed.

                                                 THE LION
The primarch of the Dark Angels was named Lion El’Jonson, but most call him simply ‘The Lion’. When the
primarchs were scattered across the galaxy, Jonson came to Caliban, growing to maturity amongst the beast-
haunted forests, not laying eyes upon another human until he was a young adult. Having proved himself to the
knightly order that defended the peoples of Caliban from the Chaos beasts of the dark forests, Jonson quickly
rose to power and led a crusade to slay the beasts and deliver the people of Caliban from their evil.

The Lion was said to have been temperamental and taciturn, but a brilliant strategist and unstoppable once decided
upon a course of action. These qualities served him well when he reunited with the Emperor and led the Dark
Angels Legion in the Great Crusade. One of the great tragedies of the Horus Heresy is that while Jonson earned
glory amongst the stars, Luther, his closest friend and trusted second in command, turned against him, leading
those Space Marines who remained on Caliban to the service of Chaos. Returning to Caliban, Jonson discovered
his blood-brother’s treachery. So terrible was his vengeance, so bitter his sense of betrayal, that the ensuing battle
saw the destruction of Caliban itself. At the conclusion of the battle, the traitor Luther was captured by the loyal
Dark Angels, but of the Lion, there was no trace.

                           The Deathwing is the First Company, or Terminator Company, of the Dark Angels Chapter. The First Company
                           of most Chapters consists of veterans who may fight in Terminator armour or in power armour, as dictated by
                           battlefield requirements. The Dark Angels, however, are unusual in maintaining an entire company that is only
                           ever fielded as Terminator squads. It is believed that when the Dark Angels Legion was divided into Chapters,
I: Character Creation




                           the Terminator armour-equipped Assault Company was split into a number of 100-strong units and each
                           assigned to a Chapter formed from the Legion. The warriors of the Deat wing perform all of the conventional
                           missions normally assigned to Terminator squads, but in addition, they act as the mailed fist of the Inner Circle.
                           Members of the Deathwing are not fully inducted into the Inner Circle, but they know far more of the Chapter’s
                           secrets than their rethren, and will stop at nothing to enact their masters’ vengeance on those who betrayed
                           the legion ten thousand years ago.
                                                                        THE RAVENWING
                           The Ravenwing is the name of the Second Company of the Dark Angels Chapter. Instead of the usual dark
                           green panoply of the rest of the Chapter, the Ravenwing’s bikes and land speeders, as well as their power
                           armour, are painted jet black, and it is this which gives the company its unique name. Although the Ravenwing
                           is highly specialised formation exceptionally skilled at scouting and assault missions, the company is much
                           more than a reconnaissance force. Its true function is vital to the ten thousand year mission of the Dark Angels.

                           Although only the company’s highest ranked officers know it, the Ravenwing’s primary role is to hunt down
                           and capture the Fallen Dark Angels. Therefore, the members of the Second Company are granted limited
                           knowledge of the secrets of the Dark Angels—much more than the Third to Tenth Companies, but far less than
                           the Deathwing and the Inner Circle.

                        The Space Marines of the Dark Angels Chapter are cunning warriors who often rely on the precise application of
                        overwhelming firepower to defeat their foes.
                           Dark Angels Space Marines gain the following benefits: +5 Ballistic Skill, +5 Intelligence, and the Stoic Defence

                           Although only the upper echelons of the Chapter are aware of the awful truth of the Dark Angels’ past, even those newly
                        recruited are possessed of a secretive, even introverted nature. The idea that outsiders are not to be trusted is drilled into
                        the recruits from an early stage, and they are tested continuously to ensure their compliance until it becomes second nature.
                        After all, a brother who cannot be entirely trusted to keep the Chapter’s secrets is unlikely to advance through its ranks.
                           Although the Dark Angels have fought beside all of the branches of the Imperium’s vast military machine, they prefer
                        to stand beside other Space Marines. Many, even brother Astartes, find the Dark Angels aloof and uncommunicative. The
                        Dark Angels, for their part are impatient and unforgiving with strangers who pry into their affairs. In truth, those Dark
                        Angels who are aware of the existence of the Fallen are ever watchful for any sign of their activity, and will abandon
                        whatever mission they are about should they gain any clue that one is nearby. In theory, even a Dark Angel seconded to
                        the Deathwatch could go “off mission” in this manner, although the annals of Watch Fortress Erioch do not relate any such
                        incident taking place.
                           The Dark Angels are also notoriously intolerant of non-humans and will often refuse to fight alongside armies that
                        include abhuman warriors or alien races. They are highly suspicious of outsiders and often appear unreasonably aloof and
                        intransigent. Indeed, there have been a number of occasions where Dark Angels have withdrawn suddenly and with no
                        explanation from a warzone when confronted by an Inquisitor or missionary.
                           Despite such incidents, many Dark Angels have served with distinction and honour in the Deathwatch. Their taciturn
                        nature and stubborn refusal to accept anything other than total victory over their foes has served the Deathwatch well, and
                        several noted Watch Commanders are drawn from the Chapter. These keep in close contact with one another, coordinating
                        the efforts of the Deathwatch across entire sectors of the Imperium.

      Over the course of the many battles of the Great Crusade and the subsequent Horus Heresy, Leman
      Russ became firm friends with Lion El’Jonson, primarch of the Dark Angels Legion. The two were
      at once beloved brothers and bitter rivals, vying all the while for honour and glory. On the world
      of Dulan, the Space Wolves and the Dark Angels were to assault an enemy-held fortress. Russ
      claimed the right to lead the attack, for the Tyrant of Dulan had insulted him publicly. But the Lion
      refused and started the assault early. Russ was furious, and after the battle was won a duel broke out
      between the brother-primarchs, in which Russ was laid low, only to regain consciousness some time
      later, after the Dark Angels had departed. To this day, whenever the Space Wolves and the Dark
      Angels serve alongside one another, a ritual duel is fought between the champions of each. Though
      rarely fatal, the outcome of the fight is regarded as an omen of the battle to come, and much
      honour is earned by those who continue the brotherly feud of their primarchs.

   The Sons of Russ is a Demeanour (see page 32) unique to Space Marines from the Space Wolves Chapter.
      The Battle-Brothers of the Space Wolves are ferocious and aggressive warriors. Though far from mindless berserkers,
   they are certainly possessed of a feral exuberance for battle. They have an overriding sense of duty and honour, and
   are driven ever onwards by a strong desire to right the many wrongs that have befallen the Imperium of Man since the
   heady days of the Great Crusade. Space Wolves exhibit a fierce sense of loyalty to their comrades in arms and this is on
   occasion extended to their compatriots in other branches of the Imperium’s military.
      Although as devoted to the Emperor as any other Space Marine Chapter, the Space Wolves express their faith not in
   prayer and piety, but in feats of arms. While the Battle-Brothers of other Chapters may spend the night before battle in
   solemn meditation, the Space Wolves are more likely to mark the eve of battle in bawdy celebration, raising overflowing
   jacks of Fenrisian ale to brothers they may be mourning once battle is done. A Space Wolf will drink and make merry,
   for tomorrow, he may die.
      In temperament, most Space Wolves are blunt and plain speaking, even to the point of giving offence to those not
   used to their ways. They abhor pretension and despise politicking. They are honest to a fault, and expect the same
   quality in those they fight alongside. Space Wolves embrace their lot with an uncomplicated enthusiasm, from the
   headstrong, newly recruited Blood Claw to the grey haired and taciturn Long Fang. Each plays the role fate lays before
   him, knowing that a life spent in service to the Emperor is a life well lived.
      In the face of an enemy attack, the warrior bounds forward like a Fenrisian wolf on the hunt, a joyous song of war
   on his lips.

                        Aspire to Glory is a Demeanour (see page 32) that is part of the beliefs and traditions of the Storm Wardens Chapter.
                           While fierce upon the field of battle, Storm Wardens are no less committed to the tenets of personal honour and
                        obligation. Generally considered clannish and aloof even by other Space Marines, Storm Wardens prefer to remain distant
                        from the Imperium at large. A Storm Warden is slow to make friends, but esteems and protects those who persevere to
                        become companions.
                           Amongst the Storm Wardens, one’s word is his bond, and honour is paramount. The night before battle is often spent
                        in meticulous planning of tactics and strategy, sharing quiet camaraderie amongst their fellow warriors. Many of the most
                        senior Battle-Brothers engage in ritualised duals, the victors gaining a coveted place in the vanguard.
                           Most Storm Wardens enjoy debate and crafting points to support their arguments, although some outsiders see these
                        tendencies as quarrelsome or insubordinate. However, once a course of action has been agreed upon, a Storm Warden will
                        set aside any dispute and carry it out. Perhaps because of their fondness for debate or their own turbulent history, Storm
                        Wardens have an interest in mysteries and engimas. This curiosity has led more than a few Battle-Brothers to volunteer for
                        the Deathwatch.
                           When battle begins, Storm Wardens fight with keen fervour, often seeking out an enemy champion or commander to
                        test his skills against.




                                                                       Kraazgrug’s Folly
                          One of the most famous of the Storm Wardens’ battles took place on the verdant plains of Keffik’s
                          World in the Scarus Sector. An Ork warband led by Warboss Kraazgrug had been ravaging a number
                          of settlements and threatened the food supply for an entire sub-sector. Just before the Orks overran
                          the last of the system’s defences, an astropathic distress signal was relayed to Sacris. In response,
                          the Storm Wardens deployed several companies of Space Marines, supported by many armoured
                          vehicles. These forces were under the command of Captain Lorgath Maclir (prior to his ascension to
                          the rank of Chapter Master) and included a handful of Space Marines from the elite First Company.
                          Maclir’s plan was to face the Warboss’ trukks and warbuggies on the open plains of the northern
                          continent. However, the Ork vehicles manoeuvred through the depths of a massive dust storm, and
                          Maclir was forced to revise his strategy. Dispatching Scout Bikers, Stormravens, and Land Speeder
                          Typhoons, he used his swiftly-moving skirmishing force to lure the main body of the greenskin’s
                          army into a box canyon. The Orks and the warboss were eliminated with an unrelenting salvo of
                          heavy weapons fire from the rim of the canyon, and no greenskin left that battlefield alive.

                                                                   The Cleansing of Vigil
                          A singularly savage conflict was fought entirely underground in the tunnels beneath the dead world
                          of Vigil. In those lightless passages, the Storm Wardens battled metre by bloody metre in a series
                          of close-range firefights against the foul Slaugth and their warrior constructs. The cleansing of Vigil
                          proved to be a crucial test of the Chapter’s resolve, as the tight quarters of the tunnels precluded
                          the use of heavy armour and the alien forces seemed particularly adept at provoking the Storm
                          Wardens into abandoning a cautious, methodical approach. The planet was cleansed at last, but at

CreatinG your own speCialities
Whilst the Specialities detailed here are purposely broad in
scope, once you’ve had some experience adventuring within
the 41st Millennium, you might find it fun to develop
something a little more specific. Perhaps you feel like making
up your own Space Marine Chapter, or maybe you have a
special kind of Space Marine you’d like to try out. If this is
the case, work closely with your GM to develop an Advance
Scheme that is balanced and sensible. Remember to make
sure that your new Speciality fits in with the other members
of your group—after all, if the Deathwatch Space Marines
cannot work smoothly together, malignant forces in the
universe will happily exploit their weaknesses.

includes the Apothecary reduces all Corruption Points he

has access to his narthecium—a special tool that assists with
battlefield surgery (see page 173).

To the average man, Space Marines are the subject of myth and legend, the
descendants of mighty heroes who went to war beside the Emperor himself. Many

are taught the names of the greatest heroes, and celebrate their greatest deeds, as
proclaimed from countless millions of pulpits across the entire Imperium.

Yet, very few will ever see a Space Marine, for their numbers are so few compared
to the great, seething mass of humanity. Only when war comes to his world, and
with it the hosts of the Imperium’s armies, will a common man have any chance
of setting eyes upon a Space Marine, let alone conversing with him.

Most common men who do have cause to interact with a Space Marine are likely
to hold him such awe that he may lose the power of words. At the very least,
a Space Marine will be regarded and addressed with great deference, even the
highest-ranking officials bowing their head to the Battle-Brother. As well they
should, for the very fact that a Space Marine has come to their world is sure sign
that the enemies of the Emperor are abroad, and only his strength and bravery
will hold them at bay.

The manner in which Space Marines are wont to interact with common Humanity
varies enormously, but most are aloof, so dedicated to their own mission, their
very nature so apart from what they once were, that they have little in common
with ordinary people. Most Space Marines care only for the traditions of their
Chapter and the task of defeating the Emperor’s enemies, and know so little
of the trivial cares of normal life that very little common ground exists. Even
when interacting with a mighty warrior, perhaps a decorated veteran Imperial
Guardsman, so total is the Space Marine’s dedication to his duty that few can live
up to his standards. It is rare indeed for a normal man to be regarded by a Space
Marine as an equal. Only the greatest of the Imperium’s heroes—men such as the
Lord Solar Macharius—have earned such an honour of counting amongst their
friends one or more Space Marines of the Adeptus Astartes.

                                                                              II: Specialities
There has been conflict between the Adeptus Ministorum and the Chapters
of the Adeptus Astartes for millennia. They are rivals in power like
any of the Imperium’s institutions, but more importantly, their beliefs
differ at a very fundamental level. In particular, there is a schism in
the clergy’s thinking concerning the Space Marines. On the one hand,
the Space Marines above all others can truly be called the sons of the
Emperor. They are wholly his creation and are even blessed with elements
of the Emperor’s own genetic structure. They are the founders of the
Imperium and the supreme defenders of Humanity. The Space Marines
are unswervingly loyal to the Emperor and would die in the defence of
his domains.

However, the Space Marine Chapters do not adhere to the teachings of
the Ecclesiarchy. Their beliefs vary wildly from Chapter to Chapter, with
each worshipping the Emperor and their primarchs to differing degrees.
They have their own traditions, ceremonies, and beliefs, some of which are
very barbaric compared to the well-ordered rites of the Ecclesiarchy.
The Space Marines worship the Emperor as a great and gifted man, but
they do not consider him a god in the same sense as preached by the
Ecclesiarchy. His blood pumps through their veins, and he is considered
the ultimate example of mankind, but he is a man nonetheless. Also, it is
a matter of debate whether the Space Marines are truly human at all.
Their genetically engineered bodies are far superior to a normal human,
enough to make them a separate race in the eyes of some. Few can relate
to a monstrous giant who can spit acid, crush a man’s skull with one
hand, and practice acts of blood sacrifice.

An uneasy compromise has been reached over the millennia, which can
be summed up as an agreement to differ. The Ecclesiarchy does not send
its Confessors and Missionaries to the Space Marine worlds, and the
Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes do not interfere with the Adeptus
Ministorum. Space Marine Chaplains are given their precious rosarius by
the Ecclesiarchy as a symbolic link between the two institutions, but the
Chaplains still preach their own version of the Imperial Creed to their
brethren.

This uneasy truce has been shattered at times when a particularly zealous
Cardinal or Confessor has roused the ire of the Space Marine Chapters
with his words or deeds. These feuds are usually resolved quickly, though
not always without bloodshed, and the relative peace between the two
organisations returns.

                                 Specialist Space Marine Ranks
    Aside from the Battle-Brothers and their superiors, a Chapter contains many more Space Marines who serve
    as specialists. Some of these, such as the Chaplains, are part of the establishment of a specific company, while
    others, such as the Techmarines, are part of a separate body within the Chapter, and attached to a battle force
    as required.

    Chaplains are mighty warriors and truly inspirational leaders. Their duty is to tend to the spiritual welfare of
    the brethren, on and off of the battlefield. Many of the sights a Space Marine must witness and many of the fell
    beings he must face are so infernal that the soul of an ordinary man would be seared to ashes. The ministrations
    of the Chaplains ensure that Space Marines remain pure of heart, armouring their souls with unshakable faith.
    Just as the Chaplains see to the spiritual well being of the Battle-Brothers, so the Apothecaries look to their
    bodily health. These warriors would give their last drop of blood that a Space Marine might continue to fight,
    and they are able to heal the most grievous of battlefield injuries. The Apothecaries are assigned the most sacred
    of duties, that of recovering the gene-seed of a fallen Battle-Brother, so that the Chapter’s genetic future might
    be ensured and his memory lives on in the inheritance of future generations of Space Marines.

    For the mightiest heroes of a Chapter, even death does not spell the end of service. Even if a Space Marine’s body
    is crippled so utterly that no hope of healing exists, his broken form may be interred into the ceramite sarcophagus
    of a Dreadnought, where his will drives a towering engine of destruction. Such heroes are mightily revered by the
    Space Marines, and the Battle-Brother’s words and deeds are the very stuff of Chapter legend.

    Those Neophytes who show an affinity for the workings of the machine are assigned to the Forge, where
    they undergo extensive training in the mastery of all of the Chapter’s weaponry and vehicles. These so-called
    Techmarines are dispatched to Mars, where they are inducted into the secrets of the Cult Mechanicus by the tech-
    priests of the Omnissiah. In battle, the Techmarines operate, maintain, and repair the Chapter’s many fearsome
    engines of war.

                                                                                                         83

Awareness encompasses the character’s subconscious ability
to react to things his conscious mind may not perceive.
He can use this Skill to notice threats—such as ambushes,
traps or cleverly hidden objects—or slight changes in the
environment—such as a faint vibration of a far off Ork

Toughness
The Carouse Skill is used to resist the effects of alcohol and
narcotics. Frequent imbibers can build up quite a tolerance to
alcohols and other drugs, remaining clear-headed and lucid
while those across the table find their judgement or capabilities
diminished. The character makes a Skill Test whenever he
suffers the effects of alcohol or similar intoxicants (naturally,
for Space Marines, this requires imbibing of truly prodigious
amounts or toxicity!). Each time he would otherwise suffer
from the effects of an intoxicant, make a Carouse Test. Failure
indicates he gains a level of Fatigue or suffers the side effects
of the substance. Should the character lose consciousness, he
remains passed out for a number of hours equal to 1d10 minus
his Toughness Bonus (minimum 1 hour).                               harder, or the Kill-team’s Brother-Chaplain might rouse his

              The Medicae Skill performs first aid for the injured, removing
              a small amount of damage by suturing lacerations, bandaging
              abrasions, and plugging punctures. A successful Medicae Test
              removes Damage equal to the character’s Intelligence Bonus
              on lightly damaged characters, or 1 Damage from heavily or
              critically damaged characters. Performing First Aid is a full
              round action. First Aid may only be applied to each wound
              once and is a full round action by you and your patient.

                       “Ability is not enough. Dedication is not enough. Even victory is
                       not enough. To become one of our number, you must embody all of
                       these, and yet be more still. What that more is I cannot tell you. Find
                       the answer in your bones, in your heart and soul, and you will be a

                       Talents are special abilities and proficiencies that a character
                       possesses either through his intrinsic nature or through the
                       application of well-practised experience. This is in contrast to
                       Skills, which represent abilities gained by learning or training.
                       A Talent is an ability that a character is either capable of or
                       is not, whereas a Skill is something that he can be better at
                       by degrees. When a Battle-Brother smites an enemy with a
                       devastating blow with his thunder hammer heedless of the

                       calls for vengeance for his fallen brother, he is using Talents.

   Humanity is in constant competition with itself for resources: from underhive denizens hunting rats through alleys to
   Rogue Traders squabbling with one another over trade routes and with endless bureaucracy. Space Marines fight more
   important battles; their Chapters provide everything they need. They have little use for the various currencies used to
   measure wealth across the Imperium. Money among the Emperor’s subjects is as varied as their worlds and cultures. The
   Calixis Sector—intimately connected with the Achilus Crusade—uses Throne Gelt as the gauge for tithes, and it has
   become the de facto standard for exchange in the sector.
      In Dark Heresy, lower ranking members of the Inquisition use Thrones for purchases, while Throne Agents rely
   on Influence to fund their pursuit of heretics. Explorers in rogue TraDer use a similar mechanic called Profit Factor to
   represent their fortunes and power. In both games, Availability drives the difficulty of using these resources to acquire
   goods or services.
      Should a Battle-Brother need to requisition an item from rogue TraDer or Dark Heresy, Table 5–1: Availability
   and Requisition provides guidance on how many Requisition Points it is likely to require. The GM may also choose to
   mandate a Renown requirement for certain items. In general, articles unique to the Adeptus Astartes are neither available to,
   nor easily usable by, Throne Agents and Rogue Traders.

             stoRm
             A weapon with the Storm Quality unleashes shots at rapid
             speed, often through use of a double-barrelled design. This
             Quality doubles the number of hits inflicted on the target
             and the amount of ammunition expended. For example, when
             firing a weapon with the Storm Quality in fully automatic
             mode, each degree of success yields two additional hits (to a
             maximum of twice the weapon’s Full Automatic rate of fire).

                          Cower Not Before the Enemy: This suit of armour has been obsessively maintained with marks of pride, bears
                          pristine heraldic depictions, and is bedecked with sashes, helmet crests, and Banner Displays. The wearer carries
                          himself tall, often heedless of cover or stealth. The armour seemingly sabotages any attempts at subtlety, and imposes a
             1
                          further –20 to all Silent Move and Concealment Tests (in addition to those imposed on standard power armour), while
                          it whirs, vents, or clanks at precisely the wrong moment. However, it also grants a +10 bonus to Command Tests, due
                          to the overwhelming force of authority and confidence the bearer projects.
                          None shall escape the Emperor’s Wrath: Incorporating a rare and prized Persecutor Target Acquisition Spirit, this
                          armour constantly scans for targets, predicting ranges, windage, and elevation, as well as passively noting bio-signs
V: Armoury




                          for later targeting recall. It makes nearly imperceptible adjustments to the aim and firing rate of the wearer, sometimes
             2            even anticipating the bearer’s movements. Many warriors are put off by such contrary behaviour, but all eventually
                          learn to become one with the intentions of their second skin. The obvious advantage gives the wearer a +5 bonus to
                          BS. However, the armour is sluggish to respond to unplanned events, as it seems to dislike the jostling of its precise
                          calculations. The wearer suffers a –10 penalty to Dodge in melee.
                          Thine arm be the scourge of the impure: The spirit of this armour has been honed by its long years of service into
                          a truly potent adversary. It has been upgraded with numerous enhancements for the sole purpose of bringing ruination
             3            to the enemies of Man in glorious close combat. Wearers claim that it knows how and when they are going to strike,
                          and come to trust it as innately as any other brother in arms. Such a suit grants the wearer +5 WS. However, its long
                          range targeting systems are difficult and temperamental. When wearing the suit’s helmet, BS tests suffer a –5 penalty.
                          Death is Joy: Some warriors are simply made to kill. This armour epitomises that archetype, and though it is of
                          comparatively recent manufacture, numberless foes have learned to fear its countenance. The longer a warrior bears
             4            this armour, the more the two become one. As time goes on, bringing a swift end to the enemies of Man is as easy
                          as breathing. Add +2 Damage to any of the wearer’s attacks that do Critical Damage and increase the damage to a
                          Horde’s Magnitude by 1 with any successful attack against a Horde.
                          A Fury like lightning: The reactions of the Angels of Death are far beyond what any normal human could achieve.
                          While Astartes power armour manages not to hinder a Battle-Brother’s natural speed, this suit goes to great lengths
             5            to enhance and optimise it. The armour’s hyper articulated joint mechanisms allow for more dextrous weight
                          manipulation, and muscle-response auto-readers translate even minute movements into powered assistance. These
                          systems grant the bearer a +5 bonus to Agility, and +1 to Initiative rolls.
                          Thy strength be legend: The raw physical strength of the Adeptus Astartes is already the stuff of legend, which all
                          power armour further enhances. This suit, however, makes the bearer’s strength truly titanic. Such armour has created
             6            tales of burning vehicles levered from atop trapped comrades and crumbling buildings supported by the Battle-Brother
                          alone. The bearer receives an extra +10 bonus to Strength, in addition to the normal bonus granted by power armour.
                          The Strength bonus from this power armour is added in after the modifications for Unnatural Strength.
                          Terror be thy friend: Though all suits of power armour are intimidating to say the least, this suit seems to project an
                          air of menace and violence. Its power core periodically emits grumbles that are often confused with the growling of a
                          wild beast. In combat, this turns into a ferocious howl and is truly a paralysing thing to face. Numerous attempts have
             7            been made to quiet this phenomena, but Tech-Priests have thus far been unable to appease the temperamental machine.
                          Many bearers enhance this effect by adding terrifying reliquary inlays and scriptures of damnation, causing their
                          impact on the weak souls of their enemies to increase considerably. The wearer gains the Fear (1) Trait against any foe
                          engaged in melee with him (or increases his Fear Rating by 1 if he already possesses one).
                          Lead from the front: All men need leaders, and all leaders need to be seen and heard to be effective. It is common
                          for the leaders of the Adeptus Astartes to lead from the front, and such warriors have had the honour of bearing this
                          armour into battle over the centuries. Its vox amplifiers ring like booming thunder, and its brilliant heraldry seems to
             8
                          blaze on the battlefield. Truly a sight to behold, there have been statues erected on a hundred worlds of the brave souls
                          who wore this relic into battle and saw the day through to victory. Add +1 Cohesion to your Squad’s total (this bonus
                          may stack with other armour with the same history).
                          Bring Death from Afar: Borne into service amidst great sieges, this armour has become accustomed to the arduous

                          firing with a pistol- or basic-class weapon on semi- or fully automatic fire (see pages 239 and 242). Additionally, the

                          fully-automatic fire.
                          To forget is to forgive. Forget nothing: Each bearer of this armour has inscribed it with an oath of vengeance
                          against those who have offended the Emperor in some way. Some inscriptions revile a single name, while some
                          condemn entire races of Xenos or planetary populations. Each successive bearer considers it a matter of honour to

                          exact the Emperor’s Vengeance upon the offender and considers it his solemn duty to put right as many of the wrongs

   The Power Armour History table is meant to provide
   ideas for the unique machine spirits that evolve in
   Astartes power armour. Players should decide on the
   specific story behind their result. For example, a suit
   with the “None shall escape the Emperor’s wrath”
   history may have enabled a famous Captain to make
   an impossible shot that killed an entrenched enemy
   leader, turning the tide at the First Siege of Khazant.

   Armour with the “Lead from the front” history should
   have a lineage of the illustrious bearers and the battles
   where they led their brothers to victory.
      Players and GMs should also not feel restricted to
   the list provided. You may wish to negotiate comparable

                attack on the Warmaster’s battle barge alongside his most trusted warriors. During the fierce fighting, the
                Emperor came face to face with Horus. In the battle that followed, Horus greivously wounded the Emperor.
                Following Horus’ defeat, the legends say that the Emperor decreed that his armour be taken off and melted
                down, and that the pieces be made into badges that all Terminators would wear in recognition of the service
                performed in the defeat of Horus. However, if this is true, then each suit of Terminator armour must only
                contain the most miniscule of fragments.

   All the types of armour detailed here are of Common craftsmanship for the groups that regularly employ them. For example,
   the Astartes power armour entry details power armour craftsmanship that is common to the Adeptus Astartes (although the
   actual craftsmanship of Space Marine power armour far outstrips any “common” standard elsewhere in the Imperium), while
   the flak armour entry details flak craftsmanship common to the Imperial Guard and general Imperial citizenry. Armour of
   better manufacture uses the following modifiers.
      Exceptional: Well constructed and better fitting, this armour is easier to wear. Against the first attack in any round, the
   armour increases its AP by 1.
      Master: Finely wrought and perfectly fitted, Master-Crafted armour is like donning a second skin. Master-Crafted
   armour weighs half the normal amount and increases AP by 1.

                         Within the Imperium, the most important function that
                     psykers have is to allow Mankind to communicate over vast
                     distances and guide Humanity’s ships through the Immaterium,
                     making travel between far flung systems possible. Without
                     them the Imperium could not exist and would splinter and
                     fall into a million isolated warring worlds. It is ironic then
                     that psykers also present the Imperium with one of its most
                     dangerous foes - a horde of living conduits to the Warp, from
                     which Daemons and dark powers hunger to bring fire and
                     ruin to Humanity. For this reason, the Imperium takes the
                     handling and rearing of psykers very seriously, and those
                     with the gift are watched very closely indeed.
                         This is as true for the Space Marines as it is for anyone
                     else, and in the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes those trained
                     and implanted with the Chapter’s gene-seed are constantly
                     screened for signs of the gift. When a Battle-Brother is found
                     to exhibit indications of psychic talent, he is given over to
                     the Librarium and the Chapter’s Chief Librarian, who will
                     determine whether or not he can master his powers and serve
                     as a Space Marine Librarian, the Adeptus Astartes’ potent
                     battle psykers, keepers of lore and shields against the worst
                     the Warp has to offer. Those that pass the trials will learn to
                     turn their gifts into deadly weapons and take an honoured
                     place among their Battle-Brothers in the constant war to
                     preserve the Imperium from its enemies.

                     powers he wields offer a Kill-team a wide variety of game
                     options and a number of unique ways to complete missions
                     or overcome foes. Primarily, however, a Librarian’s powers
                     are centred around combat and influencing or enhancing the
                     Kill-team’s abilities on the battlefield, and are mostly used to
                     tip the scales of war in the PCs’ favour. In this chapter the

                     collection of powers for the Librarian character.

            Bloody Tears: Blood weeps from stone and wood within 3d10 metres of the psyker. If there are any pictures or
45–47
            statues of people within this area, they appear to be crying blood.
            The Earth Protests: The ground suddenly shakes and everyone (including the psyker) within 5d10 metres of the
48–50
            psyker must make a Routine (+10) Agility Test or be knocked down.
            Psy Discharge: Static Electricity fills the air within 5d10 metres of the psyker, causing hair to stand on end and
51–53
            unprotected electrics to short out. The psyker is illuminated by eldritch light.
            Warp Ghosts: Ghostly apparitions fill the air within 3d10 metres of the psyker, flying around and howling in pain
54–56
            for a few brief moments. Everyone within this area must test against Fear (1).
            Falling Upwards: Everything within 2d10 metres of the psyker (including the psyker himself ) rises 1d10 metres
57–59       into the air as gravity briefly ceases. After a second or two, everything crashes back to earth. (See page 261 for rules
            on Falling Damage).
            Banshee Howl: A shrill keening rings out across the immediate area, shattering glass and forcing every mortal
60–62       creature able to hear it (including the psyker) to make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or be deafened for
            1d10 rounds.
            The Furies: The psyker is assailed by unseen horrors. He is slammed to the ground and suffers 1d5 Wounds in
63–65
            damage (Toughness protects, but armour, unless warded does not). The psyker must test against Fear (2).
            Shadow of the Warp: For a split second the world changes in appearance and everyone within 1d100 metres of
66–68       the psyker has a mercifully brief glimpse of the shadow of the Warp. Everyone in the area (including the psyker)
            must make a Difficult (–10) Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity points.

            Characters with cybernetic implants must pass a Routine (+10) Toughness Test or suffer 1d5 damage.
            Warp Madness: A violent ripple of tainted discord causes all creatures within 2d10 metres of the psyker (with the
72–74       exception of the psyker himself ) to become Frenzied for 1 Round. Affected creatures gain 1d5 Corruption Points
            unless they can pass a Difficult (–10) Willpower Test.

                                   The Gibbering: The psyker screams in pain as uncontrolled warp energies surge through his unprotected mind. He
                     01-05         must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test to avoid gaining 1d5+1 Insanity Points and becoming Stunned for

VI: Psychic Powers




                                   Psychic Concussion: With a crack of energy, the psyker is knocked unconscious for 1d5 Rounds. Everyone within
                     10–13
                                   3d10 metres of the psyker must make a Routine (+10) Willpower Test or be Stunned for 1 Round.
                                   Psy-Blast: There is an explosion of power and the psyker is thrown 1d10 metres into the air, falling to the ground.
                     14–18
                                   (See page 261 for rules on Falling Damage).
                                   Soul Sear: Warp power courses through the psyker’s body, scorching his soul. The psyker cannot use any powers for
                     19–24
                                   1 hour and gains 5 Corruption Points.
                                   Locked In: The power cages the psyker’s mind in an ethereal prison. The psyker falls to the ground in a catatonic
                     25–30         state. Each Round thereafter, he must spend a Full Action and make a Difficult (–10) Willpower Test. On a success,
                                   his mind is freed and restored to his body.
                                   Chronological Incontinence: Time warps around the psyker. He winks out of existence and reappears in 1d10
                     31–38         Rounds (or in 1 minute in narrative time). The psyker suffers 1d5 Insanity Points and 1d5 permanent Toughness
                                   damage.
                                   Psychic Mirror: The psyker’s power is turned back on him. Resolve the power’s effects as normal, but the power
                     39–46         targets the psyker instead. If the power is beneficial, it instead deals 1d10+5 Energy Damage to the psyker and the
                                   beneficial effect is cancelled. Armour is ignored by the damage unless it is warded.
                                   Warp Whispers: The voices of Daemons fill the air within 4d10 metres of the psyker, whispering terrible secrets and
                     47–55         shocking truths. Everyone in the area (including the psyker) must make a Hard (–20) Willpower Test or gain 1d10
                                   Corruption Points.
                                   Vice Versa: The psyker’s mind is thrown out of his body and into another nearby creature or person. The psyker
                                   and a random being within 50 metres of him (note that this cannot be a Daemon, Untouchable or other ‘soulless’
                                   creature) swap consciousnesses for 1d10 Rounds. The affected being may be an ally or even an enemy combatant.
                                   Each individual retains his Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship during the
                     56–58
                                   swap, but all other Characteristics are the same as those of the new host body. If either body is slain, the effect ends
                                   immediately. Both affected individuals gain 1d5 Insanity Points from the experience. If there are no beings within
                                   range, the psyker must make a Willpower Test or become catatonic for 1d5 Rounds while his mind wanders the Warp.
                                   He gains 2d10 Insanity Points from this journey.
                                   Rending the Veil: The air vibrates with images of cackling Daemons, and the kaleidoscopic taint of the Warp is
                     59–67         rendered visible. All sentient creatures (including the psyker) within 1d100 metres of the psyker must test against Fear
                                   (3). This effect lasts for 1d5 rounds.
                                   Blood Rain: A psychic storm of howling winds erupts, and a torrential rain of blood covers an area within 5d10
                                   metres of the psyker. Anyone within this area (including the psyker himself ) must pass a Challenging (+0) Strength
                     68–72
                                   Test or be knocked to the ground. If anyone uses Psychic Powers within this area, they automatically invoke a Perils
                                   of the Warp Test. The storm lasts for 1d5 Rounds
                                   Cataclysmic Blast: The psyker’s power overloads, arcing out in great bolts of warp energy. Anyone within 1d10
                     73–78         metres of the psyker (including the psyker himself ) takes 1d10+5 Energy Damage. The psyker may use no further
                                   powers for 1d5 hours after this event.
                                   A Hole in the World: A Vortex of Doom with a PR of 2d10 (see page 195) springs into existence within 1d10
                     79–82         metres of the psyker. It then begins to move randomly (roll 1d10 for the number of metres it moves and use the scatter
                                   diagram on page 248 for direction), devouring all in its path. The Vortex lasts for 1d5 Rounds and then vanishes.
                                   Lost to the Warp: The psyker must make an immediate Very Hard (–30) Willpower Test. If he fails, he is
                                   immediately dragged into the Warp by a Daemon, which possesses him and uses his body for vile purposes. The

                     83–86
                                   possessed. He gains 4d10 Corruption Points, and may experience complications caused by his actions while possessed.
                                   He may receive a visit from the Inquisition if his fate becomes known to that organisation. From now on, the psyker
                                   must adjust all Perils of the Warp checks by +10 due to his body serving as a conduit for blasphemous forces.
                                   Reality Quake: Reality buckles around the psyker, and an area within 3d10 metres of him is sundered. Solid objects
                     87–90         alternately rot, burn, and freeze, and everyone and everything in the area takes 2d10 Rending damage. Warded objects
                                   and Untouchables suffer half the damage rolled.
                                   Something is Coming...: With a blood curdling howl, a Daemon Prince (see Chapter XIII: Adversaries) rips into
                     91–99         existence within 3d10 metres of the psyker. It detests the psyker and trains its attacks on the fool that unwittingly
                                   summoned it. Only its destruction or the death of the psyker will send it back to the Warp.
                                   Destruction: The psyker is immediately and irrevocably destroyed. He is either sucked screaming into the Warp, never
                     00            to be seen again, or consumed utterly by hellfire. The GM may rule that there is a 50% chance that a Daemon Prince
                                   appears in the psyker’s place.

                               ests are the basic way of determining success or failure
                               in Deathwatch. When a Battle-Brother performs any
                               task that could have dramatic consequences—affecting
                        the story, a character’s health, the Chapter’s honour, the safety
                        of the Kill-team, and so on—a test must be performed.

                          • Determine the Skill or Characteristic to test.

                            Characteristic.
                          • Make a percentile roll (1d100).
                          • If the percentile roll is less than or equal to the Skill or
                            Characteristic being tested, the test succeeds.
                          • If the percentile roll is greater than the Skill or

                        The most common type of test a Battle-Brother performs
                        during the game is the Skill Test. Each Skill is governed by
                        a Characteristic. For example, the Dodge Skill is governed
                        by the Agility Characteristic. To make a Skill Test, add any
                        relevant modifiers to the Skill’s governing Characteristic, then
                        make a percentage roll. If the result is equal to or less than
                        the modified Characteristic, the test succeeds. If the result is
                        greater than the modified Characteristic, the test fails.

a character’s body mass as it does his Strength and Agility, so
this distance tends to vary only slightly between characters. A
character can jump up to reach an overhead ledge, or similar
object, that is as high as his own height, plus about one
metre for average arm length, plus another half a metre for
an average standing jump. Usually, no test is required to make
such a jump, though pulling oneself up onto a grabbed ledge
requires a Challenging (+0) Strength Test. A character can
attempt to safely jump down a number of metres equal to his
Agility Bonus by making a Challenging (+0) Agility Test.
If he succeeds, he lands on his feet and takes no damage. If he
succeeds, but the jump is a greater distance than his Agility
Bonus, he must take Falling Damage (see page 261) equal to
the distance jumped in metres beyond his Agility Bonus and
ends his Turn prone. If he fails the Agility Test, he suffers
Falling Damage for the entire distance of the jump and ends

If a character gets a running start by moving at least four

movement, he must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test.
If he succeeds, he can add half his Strength Bonus (rounded

plus an additional half metre for each Degree of Success. If he
fails the test, he stumbles, which ends his Turn. For every four

skill at arms and in battle that marks him out as an elite warrior

    Solo Mode abilities are special abilities that can be used
by a Battle-Brother when in Solo Mode and represent part
of the specialised training and benefits that come with being
a member of the Adeptus Astartes. Solo Mode abilities are
divided into two categories: Codex abilities and Chapter
abilities. The first represent the Battle-Brother’s own personal
combat style-often honed over many years of bloody combat
and born from both experience on the battlefield as well as the
sacred teaching of the Codex Astartes. The second incorporates
a Battle-Brother’s heritage in the form of Chapter abilities, the
result of both genetics and training passed down to him by the
teaching of his Primarch. Chapter abilities are unique to each
Chapter and can only be used by members of that Chapter
who possess the special skills or genetic gifts to utilise them.
Solo Mode abilities are always available to the Battle-Brother
once he has met the requirements to attain them and can be
used to enhance his other abilities such as those gained from
Talents, Skills, or special equipment.
    Solo Mode abilities are presented in the following way:
    Title: The name of the ability.
    Required Rank: The minimum Rank that must be attained
before the ability can be accessed. In the case of Codex
abilities, as long as a Battle-Brother has the required Rank, he
can use the ability. In the case of the Chapter abilities, Battle-
Brothers can use their own Chapter abilities but not those of
other Chapters.
    Effects: A detailed description of how the ability works
in game, including how the Battle-Brother can activate and
benefit from it.
    Improvement: Most abilities improve as a Battle-Brother’s
Rank increases. This section describes how increases in Rank
enhance the ability and boost its effects.

                        Required Rank: 1
                        Effects: Storm Wardens often choose to prove their honour
                        and bravery by facing foes in single combat and duelling to
                        the death. Once per combat as a Free Action, a Battle-Brother
                        of the Storm Wardens Chapter may issue a Thunder’s Call
                        against any single enemy which can both see and hear him
                        (though it need not be able to understand his language). As

                        target, and none of his allies attack the target, he gains +10
                        to Weapon Skill Tests against it. In addition, as long as the

                        it suffers –10 to make attacks against anyone but the Storm

                        duelling skills mean that he may re-roll both Parry and

                        the Emperors sons. This pride and unshakable personal belief
                        often manifests itself in their leadership abilities and the
                        example they set to other members of the Adeptus Astartes.

                        In addition, their strength of leadership means that the

                        the squad leader. This bonus to Cohesion remains active even
                        when the Battle-Brother is not in Solo Mode.

                        another Battle-Brother loses its effects should he move out of

                        Squad Advance Squad Mode ability which is being sustained by
                        Andrew’s character. At the start of his character’s Turn, Damien
                        decides to have his character return to Solo Mode, losing the benefits
                        of the Squad Advance for himself. Both Andrew and Jim, however,
                        continue to benefit from the Squad Advance, as Andrew is sustaining
                        it and they are still within Support Range. In Andrew’s turn however
                        he chooses to end the ability. This means that both his character and
                        Jim’s character both immediately lose its benefits.

                        Mode ability that is already being sustained. As long as he is
                        in Squad Mode, not using or benefiting from another Squad
                        Mode ability, and within Support Range of the Battle-Brother
                        sustaining the ability, he can join as a Free Action at the start of
                        any of his Turns, immediately gaining the ability’s benefits.

                        Jim is sustaining the Fire for Effect ability with Andrew’s character
                        also gaining the benefit. Having switched back into Squad Mode,
                        Damien’s character wishes to join in the effects. Since he is neither
                        benefiting from another Squad Mode ability nor outside of Support
                        Range, he simply uses a Free Action at the start of his Turn and
                        gains its effects.

Effects: Space Wolves are skilled at baiting an opponent or
distracting an enemy at a critical time so that another Space

single target, another Space Marine within support range may
voluntarily give up an unused reaction to distract the target.

against that target may not be parried or dodged this turn.

adapted this tactic to other forms of melee combat. While this

                            The attack wreathes the arm in flame, scorching clothing and armour, and temporarily fusing together the target’s

                            With a terrible snapping sound, the heat of the attack boils the marrow in the target’s arm, causing it to shatter. The
               7            target’s arm is broken and until it is repaired the target counts as only having one arm. The target is Stunned for 1

                            Energy sears through the arm at the shoulder, causing the limb to be severed from the body. The target must take a

                            The fury of the attack forces the target to the ground, helplessly covering his face and keening in agony. The target is
               5            knocked to the ground and must make an Agility Test or catch fire (see Special Damage). The target takes 1d5 levels of
                            Fatigue and must take the Stand Action to regain his feet.
                            Struck by the full force of the attack, the target is sent reeling to the ground, smoke spiralling out of the wound. The
               6            target is knocked to the ground, Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, and takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. In addition, he must make
                            an Agility Test or catch fire (see Special Damage on page 210).
                            The intense power of the energy attack cooks the target’s organs, burning his lungs and heart with intense heat. The
               7
                            target is Stunned for 2d10 Rounds and reduces his Toughness by half (round down).
                            As the attack washes over the target, his skin turns black and peels off while body fat seeps out of his clothing and
               8            armour. The target is Stunned for 2d10 Rounds and the attack halves his Strength, Toughness and Agility. The
                            extensive scarring permanently halves the target’s Fellowship characteristic.
                            The target is completely encased in fire, melting his skin and popping his eyes like superheated eggs. He falls to the

           In a gruesome display, the flesh is burned from the target’s head, exposing charred bone and muscle underneath. The
7          target is blinded permanently and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue. Also, roll 1d10. This is the target’s new Fellowship,
           unless their Fellowship is already 10 or less, in which case nobody really notices the difference.

8          The target’s head is destroyed in a convocation of fiery death. He does not survive.

           Superheated by the attack, the target’s brain explodes, tearing apart his skull and sending flaming chunks of meat flying

1          A blow to the leg leaves the target gasping for air. The target gains 1 level of Fatigue.

3          The blast breaks the target’s leg leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and halving all movement for 1d5 Rounds.
           A solid blow to the leg sends electric currents of agony coursing through the target. The target takes 1d5 levels of

           target gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The target now only has one leg.
           Energy sears through the bone, causing the leg to be severed. The target must take a Toughness Test or become
8          Stunned for 1 Round. In addition the target gains 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is suffering from Blood Loss. The target
           now only has one leg.
           The force of the attack reduces the leg to little more than a chunk of sizzling gristle. The target make a Challenging
9
           (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. The leg is utterly lost.
           In a terrifying display of power, the leg immolates and fire consumes the target completely. The target dies in a matter
10+
           of agonising seconds




                                                                                                                       253

               1            The attack throws the limb backwards, painfully jerking it away from the body, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue.
               2            The attack sends a fracture through the limb. The target drops anything held in the hand and takes 2 levels of Fatigue.
                            The explosion takes 1d5 fingers from the target’s hand. The target takes 3 levels of Fatigue and anything carried in the
               3
                            hand is destroyed. If this is an explosive, it goes off. Messy.
                            The blast causes the target to howl in agony. He takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, is Stunned for 1 Round, and the limb is
               4
                            useless until medical attention is received.
VIII: Combat




                            Fragments from the explosion tear into the target’s hand, ripping away flesh and muscle alike. He must immediately
               5            Test Toughness or lose the hand. Even on a success, the hand is useless until medical attention is received. The target
                            takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
                            The explosive attack shatters the bone and mangles the flesh turning the target’s arm into a red ruin, inflicting 1d5
               6            levels of Fatigue. The target’s arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm. In addition,
                            the horrendous nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss.
                            In a violent hail of flesh, the arm is blown apart. The target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness
               7            Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 rounds, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and suffers
                            Blood Loss. He now only has one arm.
                            The arm disintegrates under the force of the explosion taking a good portion of the shoulder and chest with it. The
               8
                            target is sent screaming to the ground, where he dies in a pool of his own blood and organs.
                            With a mighty bang the arm is blasted from the target’s body, killing the target instantly in a rain of blood droplets. In
               9            addition, if the target was carrying a weapon with a power source in his hand (such as a power sword or chainsword)
                            then it explodes, dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within two metres.
                            As above, except if the target is carrying any ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within
               10+          1d10 metres (this is in addition to Damage caused by exploding power weapons noted above). If the target is carrying
                            any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on his person.

               1            The target is blown backwards 1d5 metres and takes 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. He is Prone when he lands.
                            The target is blown backwards 1d10 metres, taking 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. If he strikes a solid object, he
               2
                            takes 1d5 additional levels of Fatigue.
                            The explosion destroys whatever armour protected the body. If the target wore none, the target is blown backwards
               3
                            1d10 metres, as above but the target takes 2 levels of Fatigue for every metre travelled.
                            The explosion sends the target sprawling to the ground. He takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, is Stunned for 1 Round, and
               4
                            must spend a Full Action to regain his feet.
                            Concussion from the explosion knocks the target to the ground and tenderises his innards. The target falls down
               5
                            Stunned for 1 Round and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.
                            Chunks of the target’s flesh are ripped free by the force of the attack leaving large, weeping wounds. The target is
               6
                            Stunned for 1 Round, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is now suffering Blood Loss.
                            The explosive force of the attack ruptures the target’s flesh and scrambles his nervous system, knocking him to the
               7            ground. The target falls down, is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue. In addition, he now
                            suffers Blood Loss and can only take Half Actions for the next 1d10 hours as he tries to regain control of his body.
                            The target’s chest explodes outward, disgorging a river of partially cooked organs onto the ground, killing him
               8
                            instantly.
                            Pieces of the target’s body fly in all directions as he is torn into bloody gobbets by the attack. In addition, if the target
               9            is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is
                            carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on the target’s person.
                            As above, except anyone within 1d10 metres of the target is drenched in gore and must make a Challenging (+0)
               10+
                            Agility Test or suffer a –10 penalty to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests for 1 Round as blood fouls their sight.

1          The explosion leaves the target confused. He can take only a Half Action on his next Turn and takes 1 level of Fatigue.

2          The flash and noise leaves the target blind and deaf for 1 Round. The target takes 2 levels of Fatigue.

3          The detonation leaves the target’s face a bloody ruin from scores of small cuts. The target takes 2 levels of Fatigue.




                                                                                                                                        VIII: Combat
4          The force of the burst knocks the target to the ground and Stuns him for 1 Round. The target takes 2 levels of Fatigue.

           The explosion flays the flesh from the target’s face and bursts his eardrums with its force. The target is Stunned for
5          1d10 Rounds and is permanently deafened. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and can only take Half Actions for
           1d5 hours. Finally, the target’s Fellowship drops by 1d10 due to hideous scarring.
           The target’s head explodes under the force of the attack, leaving his headless corpse to spurt blood from the neck for
6
           the next few minutes. Needless to say this is instantly fatal.
           Both head and body are blown into a mangled mess, instantly killing the target. In addition, if the target is carrying any
7          ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to any creatures within 1d5 metres. If the target was carrying
           grenades or missiles, these too explode on the target’s person.
           In a series of unpleasant explosions the target’s head and torso peel apart, leaving a gory mess on the ground. For the
8
           rest of the fight, anyone moving over this spot must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or fall prone.
           The target ceases to exist in any tangible way, entirely turning into a kind of crimson mist. You don’t get much deader
9
           than this, except…
           As above, except such is the unspeakably appalling manner in which the target was killed, that any of the target’s allies
10+        who are within two metres of where the target stood, must make an immediate Challenging (+0) Willpower Test or
           spend their next Turn fleeing from the attacker.

1          A glancing blast sends the character backwards one metre.
2          The force of the explosion takes the target’s feet out from under him. He lands Prone and takes 1 level of Fatigue.
           The concussion cracks the target’s leg, leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and halving all movement for 1d5 Rounds.
3
           The target takes 1 level of Fatigue.
           The explosion sends the target spinning through the air. The target travels 1d5 metres away from the explosion
4          and takes 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. It takes the target a Full Action to regain his feet and he halves all
           movement for 1d10 Rounds.
           Explosive force removes part of the target’s foot and scatters it over a wide area. The target must make an immediate
5          Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or permanently lose the use of his foot, inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. On a
           success, the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and halves his movement until he receives medical attention.
           The concussive force of the blast shatters the target’s leg bones and splits apart his flesh, inflicting 1d10 levels of
6          Fatigue. The leg is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one leg. In addition, the horrendous
           nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss.
           The explosion reduces the target’s leg into a hunk of smoking meat. The target must immediately make a Challenging
7          (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. On a successful Test, the target is still Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, takes 1d10
           levels of Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.
           The blast tears the leg from the body in a geyser of gore, sending him crashing to the ground, blood pumping from the
8
           ragged stump: instantly fatal.
           The leg explodes in an eruption of blood, killing the target immediately and sending tiny fragments of bone, clothing,
9
           and armour hurtling off in all directions. Anyone within two metres of the target takes 1d10+2 Impact Damage.
           As above, except in addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to
10+
           anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on the target’s person.

               1            The attack numbs the target’s limb causing him to drop anything held in that hand.

               2            The strike leaves a deep bruise. The target takes 1 level of Fatigue.

               3            The impact inflicts crushing pain and the target takes 1 level of Fatigue and drops whatever was held in that hand.

                            The impact leaves the target reeling from pain. The target is Stunned for 1 Round. The limb is useless for 1d5 Rounds

                            and the target takes 1 level of Fatigue.
                            Muscle and bone take a pounding as the attack rips into the arm. The target’s Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill are both
               5            halved (round down) for 1d10 Rounds. In addition, the target takes 1 level of Fatigue and must make an Agility Test or
                            drop anything held in that hand.
                            The attack pulverises the target’s hand, crushing and breaking 1d5 fingers (for the purposes of this Critical, a thumb
               6            counts a finger). The target takes 1 level of Fatigue and must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test
                            or lose the use of his hand.
                            With a loud snap, the arm bone is shattered and left hanging limply at the target’s side, dribbling blood onto the
               7
                            ground. The arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm and takes 2 levels of Fatigue.
                            The force of the attack takes the arm off just below the shoulder, showering blood and gore across the ground. The
               8            target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. If he passes the Test, he is still
                            Stunned for 1d10 rounds, takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is suffers from Blood Loss. He now only has one arm.
                            In a rain of blood, gore and meat, the target’s arm is removed from his body. Screaming incoherently, he twists about in
               9
                            agony for a few seconds before collapsing to the ground and dying.
                            As above, except as the arm is removed it is smashed apart by the force of the attack, and bone, clothing and armour
               10+          fragments fly about like shrapnel. Anyone within 2 metres of the target suffers 1d5–3 Impact Damage to a random
                            location (see Table 9–8: Hit Locations).

               1            A blow to the target’s body steals the breath from his lungs. The target can take only a Half Action on his next Turn.

               2            The impact punches the air from the target’s body, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue.

               3            The attack breaks a rib and inflicts 2 levels of Fatigue. The target is also Stunned for 1 Round.

               4            The blow batters the target, shattering ribs. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is Stunned for 1 Round.

                            A solid blow to the chest winds the target and he momentary doubles over in pain, clutching himself and crying in
               5
                            agony. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is Stunned for 2 Rounds.
                            The attack knocks the target sprawling on the ground. The target flies 1d5 metres away from the attacker and falls
               6            prone (if the target strikes a wall or other solid object, he stops). The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is Stunned
                            for 2 Rounds.
                            With an audible crack, 1d5 of the target’s ribs break. The target can either lay down and stay still awaiting medical
               7            attention (a successful Medicae Test sets the ribs) or continue to take Actions, though each Round there is a 20% chance
                            that a jagged rib pierces a vital organ and kills the character instantly. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
                            The force of the attack ruptures several of the target’s organs and knocks him down, gasping in wretched pain. The
               8
                            target suffers Blood Loss and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.
                            The target jerks back from the force of the attack, throwing back his head and spewing out a jet of blood before
               9
                            crumpling to the ground dead.
                            As above, except the target is thrown 1d10 metres away from the attack. Anyone in the target’s path must make a

                            Challenging (+0) Agility Test or be Knocked Down.

5          The force of the blow sends the target reeling in pain. The target is Stunned for 1 Round.

           The target’s head is snapped back by the attack leaving him staggering around trying to control mind-numbing pain.

           The target is Stunned for 1d5 Rounds and takes 2 levels of Fatigue.

7
           for 1d10 Rounds and halves all movement for 1d10 hours.
           Blood pours from the target’s noise, mouth, ears and eyes as the attack pulverises his brain. He does not survive the
8
           experience.
           The target’s head bursts like an overripe fruit and sprays blood, bone and brains in all directions. Anyone within 4
9          metres of the target must make an Agility Test or suffer a –10 penalty to their WS and BS on their next Turn as gore
           gets in their eyes or on their visors.
           As above, except that the attack was so powerful that it passes through the target and may hit another target nearby. If
           the hit was from a melee weapon, the attacker may immediately make another attack (with the same weapon) against
10+        any other target they can reach without moving. If the hit was from a ranged weapon they may immediately make
           another attack (with the same weapon) against any target standing directly behind the original target and still within
           range of their weapon.

           The blow breaks the target’s leg leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and halving all movement for 1d5 Rounds. The
3
           target takes 1 level of Fatigue.
           A solid blow to the leg sends lightning agony coursing through the target. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and
4
           halves all movement for 1d5 Rounds.
           A powerful impact causes micro fractures in the target’s bones, inflicting considerable agony. The target’s Agility is
5
           reduced by –20 for 1d10 Rounds and he takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
           Several of the tiny bones in the target’s foot snap like twigs with cracking noises. The target must make an
6          immediate Toughness Test or permanently lose the use of his foot. On a success, halve all movement until medical
           attention is received. The target takes 2 levels of Fatigue.
           With a nasty crunch, the leg is broken and the target is knocked down mewling in pain. The target falls to the
7          ground with a broken leg and, until it is repaired, he counts as only having one leg. The target takes 2 levels of
           Fatigue.
           The force of the attack rips the lower half of the leg away in a stream of blood. The target must immediately make
8          a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 rounds, takes
           1d5 levels of Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss. He now only has one leg.
           The hit rips apart the flesh of the leg, causing blood to spray out in all directions. Even as the target tries futilely to
9
           stop the sudden flood of vital fluid, he falls to the ground and dies in a spreading pool of gore.
           As above, but such is the agony of the target’s death that his piteous screams drowns out all conversation within
10+
           2d10 metres for the rest of the Round.



                                                                                                                             257

               2            Deep cuts cause the target to drop whatever was held and inflicts 1 level of Fatigue.
                            The shredding attack sends the target screaming in pain. He takes 2 levels of Fatigue and drops whatever was held in
               3
                            that hand.
                            The attack flays the skin from the limb, filling the air with blood and the sounds of his screaming. The target falls prone
               4
                            from the agony and takes 2 levels of Fatigue. The limb is useless for 1d10 Rounds.
VIII: Combat




                            A bloody and very painful looking furrow is opened up in the target’s arm. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue
               5            and vomits all over the place in agony. He drops whatever was held and the limb is useless until medical attention is
                            received. The target also suffers Blood Loss.
                            The blow mangles flesh and muscle as it hacks into the target’s hand, liberating 1d5 fingers in the process (a roll of
               6            a 5 means that the thumb has been sheared off ). The target takes 3 levels of Fatigue and must immediately make a
                            Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or lose the use of his hand.
                            The attack rips apart skin, muscle, bone and sinew with ease, turning the target’s arm into a dangling ruin and inflicting
               7            1d5 levels of Fatigue. The arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm. In addition,
                            numerous veins have been severed and the target is now suffering from Blood Loss.
                            With an assortment of unnatural, wet ripping sounds, the arm flies free of the body trailing blood behind it in a crimson
               8            arc. The target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. If he passes the Test,
                            he is Stunned for 1d10 Turns and suffers Blood Loss. He also takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and now has only one arm.
                            The attack slices clean through the arm and into the torso, drenching the ground in blood and gore and killing the
               9
                            target instantly.
                            As above. However, as the arm falls to the ground its fingers spasm uncontrollably, pumping the trigger of any held
               10+          weapon. If the target was carrying a ranged weapon there is a 5% chance that a single randomly determined target
                            within 2d10 metres will be hit by these shots, in which case resolve a single hit from the target’s weapon as normal.

                            If the target is not wearing armour on this location, he takes 1 level of Fatigue from a painful laceration. If he is
               1
                            wearing armour, there is no effect. Phew!
                            The attack damages the target’s armour, reducing its Armour Points by 1. In addition, the target takes 1 level of Fatigue.
               2
                            If not armoured, the target is also Stunned for 1 Round.
                            The attack rips a large patch of skin from the target’s torso, leaving him gasping in pain. The target is Stunned for 1
               3
                            Round and takes 2 levels of Fatigue.
                            A torrent of blood spills from the deep cuts, making the ground slick with gore. All characters attempting to move
               4
                            through this pool of blood must succeed on an Agility Test or fall Prone. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
                            The blow opens up a long wound in the target’s torso, causing him to double over in terrible pain. The target takes 1d5
               5
                            levels of Fatigue.
                            The mighty attack takes a sizeable chunk out of the target and knocks him to the ground as he clutches the oozing
               6
                            wound, shrieking in pain. The target is Prone and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.
                            The attack cuts open the target’s abdomen. The target can either choose to use one arm to hold his guts in (until a
                            medic can bind them in place with a successful Medicae Test), or fight on regardless and risk a 20% chance each turn
               7
                            that his middle splits open, spilling his intestines all over the ground, causing an additional 2d10 Damage. In either
                            case, the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is now suffering Blood Loss.
                            With a vile tearing noise, the skin on the target’s chest comes away revealing a red ruin of muscle. The target must make
               8            a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die. If he passes, he permanently loses 1d10 from his Toughness, takes 1d10
                            levels of Fatigue, and now suffers Blood Loss.
                            The powerful blow cleaves the target from gullet to groin, revealing his internal organs and spilling them on to the
               9
                            ground before him. The target is now quite dead.
                            As above, except that the area and the target are awash with gore. For the rest of the fight, anyone moving within four
               10+
                            metres of the target’s corpse must make make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or fall prone.

           The attack slices open the target’s scalp which immediately begins to bleed profusely. Due to blood pouring into the
2          target’s eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty to both Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill for the next 1d10 Turns. The target takes
           1 level of Fatigue.
           The attack tears the target’s helmet from his head. If wearing no helmet, the target loses an ear instead and inflicts 2

           The attack scoops out one of the target’s eyes, inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue and leaving the target Stunned for 1
4
           Round.
           The attack opens up the target’s face, leaving him Stunned for 1d5 Rounds and inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. If the
5
           target is wearing a helmet, the helmet comes off.
           As the blow rips violently across the target’s face—it takes with it an important feature. Roll 1d10 to see what the
           target has lost. 1–3: Eye (see Permanent Effects on page 201), 4–7: Nose (permanently halve Fellowship), 8–10: Ear
6
           (permanently reduce Fellowship by 1d10; the wound can always be hidden with hair.) In addition, the target is now
           suffering Blood Loss and takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
           In a splatter of skin and teeth, the attack removes most of the target’s face. He is permanently blinded and has his
7          Fellowship permanently reduced to 1d10, and also now has trouble speaking without slurring his words. In addition,
           the target is suffering from Blood Loss and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.
           The blow slices into the side of the target’s head causing his eyes to pop out and his brain to ooze down his cheek like
8
           spilled jelly. He’s dead before he hits the ground.
           With a sound not unlike a wet sponge being torn in half, the target’s head flies free of its body and sails through the air,
9
           landing harmlessly 2d10 metres away with a soggy thud. The target is instantly slain.
           As above, except the target’s neck spews blood in a torrent, drenching all those nearby and forcing them to make a
10+        Challenging (+0) Agility Test. Anyone who fails the Test, suffers a –10 penalty to his Weapon Skill and Ballistic
           Skill Tests for 1 Round as gore fills his eyes or fouls his visor.

           The attack rips the kneecap free from the target’s leg, causing it to collapse out from under him. The target moves at

           half speed until medical attention is received. In addition, he takes 2 levels of Fatigue.
           In a spray of blood, the target’s leg is opened up, exposing bone, sinew and muscle. The target takes 1d5 levels of
5
           Fatigue and halves his movement for 1d10 hours.
           The blow slices a couple of centimetres off the end of the target’s foot. The target must make an immediate
6          Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or permanently lose the use of his foot. On a success, movement is halved until he
           receives medical attention. In either case, the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.
           The force of the blow cuts deep into the leg, grinding against bone and tearing ligaments apart. The leg is broken and,
7          until repaired, the target counts as having only one leg. In addition, the level of maiming is such that the target is now
           suffering from Blood Loss. He also takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.
           In a single bloody hack the leg is lopped off the target, spurting its vital fluids across the ground. The target must
8          immediately make a Toughness Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, takes
           1d10 Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.
           With a meaty chop, the leg comes away at the hip. The target pitches to the ground howling in agony, before dying
9
           moments later.
           As above, except that the tide of blood is so intense that, for the remainder of the battle, anyone making a Run or
10+
           Charge Action within six metres of the target this Turn must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or fall over.

                  1st to 5th Millennia—The Age of Terra
                  Humanity dominates Earth. Civilisations rise and fall. The Solar System is colonised. Mankind lives
                  on Mars and the moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune.
X: The Imperium




                  15th to 18th Millennia—The Dark Age of Technology
                  Mankind begins to colonise the stars using sub-light spacecraft. At first only nearby systems can be
                  reached and the colonies must survive as independent states since they are separated from Earth by up
                  to ten generations of travel.

                  18th to 22nd Millennia—The Dark Age of Technology
                  The invention of the warp drive accelerates colonisation of the galaxy. Federations and empires are
                  founded. The first aliens are encountered and the first Alien Wars are fought. The first human psykers
                  are scientifically proven to exist and begin to appear throughout the human worlds.
                  22nd to 25th Millennia—The Dark Age of Technology
                  The first Navigators are born, allowing human spaceships to make even longer, quicker warp jumps.
                  Mankind enters a golden age of enlightenment as scientific and technological progress accelerates.
                  Human worlds unite and non-aggression pacts are secured with dozens of alien races.

                  25th to 26th Millennia—The Age of Strife
                  Terrible warp storms interrupt interstellar travel. Sporadic at first, the storms eventually prevent any
                  warp jumps being made. The incidence of human mutation increases rapidly and Mankind enters a
                  dark period of anarchy and despair.

                  26th to 30th Millennia—The Age of Strife
                  Human worlds are ripped apart by civil wars, revolts, alien predation and invasion. Human psykers and
                  other mutants dominate some worlds and these rapidly fall prey to warp creatures, leaving Humanity
                  on the brink of extinction.

                  30th Millennium—The Great Crusade
                  Earth is conquered by the Emperor and enters an alliance with the Mechanicum of Mars. The warp
                  storms finally abate and interstellar travel is possible again. The Emperor builds the Astronomican and
                  creates the Space Marine Legions. Human worlds are reunited by the Emperor in a Great Crusade that
                  lasts for two hundred years.

                  31st Millennium—The Horus Heresy
                  Warmaster Horus, the Emperor’s most beloved gene-son, turns upon those he was sworn to serve and
                  leads one third of Humanity’s hosts against Earth. The Emperor faces his erstwhile servant in single
                  combat. The Master of Mankind is victorious, yet suffers such horrific wounds that only his ascension
                  to the life-sustaining Golden Throne can save him. The Age of the Imperium begins.

                  31st to 41st Millennia—The Age of the Imperium
                  Humanity is bound within the organisations and societies of the Imperial administration. The
                  Emperor’s life is only maintained by the arcane workings of the Golden Throne and continuous human
                  sacrifice. Imperial servants work for the furtherance of Humanity and its survival against the myriad
                  perils that threaten to destroy it. Psykers and the horrors of warp space are controlled by the vigilance
                  of the Inquisition, planetary commanders, and other Imperial servants. Psykers continue to emerge
                  in ever greater numbers. Anarchic, anti-governmental and predatory groups associated with warp
                  creatures and alien domination are steadily gaining power in spite of every effort to suppress them.

                  tithes to the Imperium, in the form of resources and military
                  units, and maintains a strict cull of its psyker population.
                  Beyond these responsibilities, planets are largely free to
                  administer themselves as they see fit.
                      Although every planet has an individual who holds the
                  rank of Imperial Commander, the exact form of governance
                  varies enormously. On most worlds, the Imperial Commander
                  has inherited the title from a long line of predecessors, perhaps
                  being able to trace the lineage back to the world’s first colonists,
                  liberators or conquerors. Other planets are ruled by a council,
                  the chair of which holds the rank of Imperial Commander so
                  long as he presides. On a small number of worlds the populace
                  decides who will rule them, though such regimes rarely survive
                  in the age of war that is the 41st Millennium.
                      Although each world is effectively independent, the
                  Imperium is divided up into sectors and sub-sectors. The
                  worlds of these regions are often interdependent to some
                  degree. For example densely populated Hive worlds rely
                  on nearby agricultural worlds to feed their populations.
                  Even if not directly dependent, there exists some manner
                  of federation, for the benefit of trade and mutual defence,
                  which is normally presided over by a Sector Lord, a powerful
                  individual appointed by the Adeptus Terra. Sector Lords do
                  not have direct control over Imperial Commanders and their
                  worlds, but they do have a lot of control over trade and other
                  matters affecting how the world interacts with the Imperium at
                  large, a fact that often gives them great influence and leverage
                  over Imperial Commanders that rely on other planets to
                  sustain themselves.

                         It is relatively unusual for a Watch Captain to accompany his
                     warriors on a mission, but he occasionally does so if especially
                     dangerous foes are being faced and his personal intervention
                     might turn the battle. In many cases, the Watch Captain oversees
                     a mission from nearby, often in a Thunderhawk gunship

                     centre, emergency surgery, arsenal and quarantine facility for
                     captured foes. From his gunship, the Watch Captain is able to
                     monitor the progress of the mission, seeing exactly what each
                     Battle-Brother sees by way of the multi-band sensors built into
                     their power armour. He can also monitor the physiological
                     condition of his warriors, ensuring that no alien biological
                     contaminants are transmitted onwards on their return.
                         When the Watch Captains do take to the battlefield, their
                     presence can turn the tide of combat. A Watch Captain is both

                     of a gargantuan alien terror capable of wiping out an entire
                     army, and discern immediately its most vulnerable weakness.
                     The Watch Captains of the Deathwatch are amongst the most
                     heroic of the Imperium’s servants, even if their names and their

                                  There are some worlds in the galaxy that are known to harbour life forms
                                  so dangerous or vile that the Imperium has imposed a quarantine upon them,
                                  that none may set foot upon the surface. Many of these are classified as

                                 THE DEATHWATCH AND THE CODEX ASTARTES
                       Although counted as a Chapter, the Deathwatch has a highly unusual organisation, which bears little
                       resemblance to that laid down in the Codex Astartes. While a regular, ‘Codex’ Chapter is organised so as
                       to be highly mobile and flexible, and to be deployed almost anywhere in the galaxy on short notice, the
                       Deathwatch often focuses on one threat, in one region. This means that a Watch Commander is able to
                       tailor his forces to the task at hand. Some Watch Fortresses stand guard over vast Ork empires, ever ready
                       to oppose the nigh-unstoppable invasions they periodically unleash. Others guard against more shadowy
                       threats, far harder to detect yet every bit as dangerous. Still more face a myriad of foes and must constantly
                       adapt to an ever-changing strategic situation.

                       The Deathwatch has access to all of the specialised war machines used by other Chapters, and more. Even
                       if a Watch Fortress makes no regular use of such equipment, it keeps mothballed stocks of everything from
                       attack bikes to strike cruisers, for use as and when required.

                       In structure, the Deathwatch does not adhere to the strict organisation of squads and companies that the Codex
                       Astartes dictates. The only relevant tactical unit is the Kill-team, which may be organised and equipped in any
                       way the Watch Captains deem appropriate. In one mission the team may go to war on Space Marine bikes, and in
                       the next mounted on a mighty Land Raider. Those Battle-Brothers with the requisite knowledge might go to war
                       clad in hulking Terminator armour, or in lightweight Scout armour with chameleonic cloaks. Occasionally, several
                       Kill-teams are combined into a larger force, a sure sign that a highly dangerous foe is to be faced.

                       It is perhaps inevitable that Space Marines new to a term of service in the Deathwatch might experience
                       a period in which they must adjust to this foreign mode of organisation. This is especially the case when it
                       comes to Chapters that adhere rigidly to the Codex Astartes, such as the Ultramarines and their Successors.
                       In practice, a Battle-Brother who could not adjust would not be sent to the Deathwatch, and those that
                       do are often the most highly effective of warriors.

The Tyranids are the most alien of the races to curse the galaxy
with their existence. An elemental force, they mass in void-
swimming shoals, remorselessly hungry and too numerous to
stop. The Tyranids are believed to have migrated from beyond
the known galaxy in search of new systems to consume;
ravening swarms descending upon planets and stripping them
of all life. Every living thing is consumed, brought back to
the hive ships and dissolved into a rich biological gruel from
which new Tyranid organisms are grown. When the Tyranids
move on in search of fresh prey, they leave planets as nothing
but balls of scoured rock in their wake.
    Unlike many other alien threats facing Mankind, the
Tyranids are an entirely new enemy. The arrival of this galactic
threat first came to light when Inquisitor Kryptman of the
Ordo Xenos recovered a data-slate from the barren husk
that had once been the Imperial world of Tyran. The alien
fleets were composed of an innumerable tide of living craft,
from biological attack vessels to gargantuan, tentacled hive
ships — all cells in a single alien organism that threatened to
devour the Imperium. Codified as ‘Behemoth’, the Tyranid
invasion devoured entire sectors, and culminated in one of
the largest space battles in the Imperium’s history, around
the rings of Circe. Both the Ultramarines and Battlefleet
Tempestus suffered terrible casualties before the invasion was
finally broken.

                     “Everywhere Mankind has travelled, there too are the Orks. They

                                              –Watch Captain Evangelos, Deathwatch
XI: The Deathwatch




                     Orks are green-skinned monsters that live only to fight,
                     joyously spreading carnage and mayhem wherever they go.
                     Though categorised as sentient creatures, many consider the
                     term ‘intelligent life form’ highly inappropriate, for these beasts
                     are crude, barbaric and have absolutely no concept of their
                     own mortality. So great is the Orks’ need for battle that they
                     fight amongst themselves if no enemies are near. This constant
                     state of war ensures that only the very strongest, toughest and
                     loudest of Orks survive to face their enemies.
                         If the attentions of the Orks were engaged entirely upon
                     their internecine wars, then the race would present little threat
                     to the galaxy at large. Unfortunately for the galaxy, the Orks are
                     more numerous than any other race, infesting planets from the
                     Core to the Halo worlds. As if this were not bad enough, what
                     makes the race truly dangerous is the fact that periodically, a
                     single individual will fight his way to the top of Ork society,
                     uniting by force and example the disparate factions and leading
                     them in an invasion akin to a holy war. This invasion the Orks
                     call a ‘Waaagh!’ in their guttural tongue, a word learned by the

                     to make the Orks more weapons, or simply eaten.                          the idea that when an Ork is slain, the release of thousands of

                     body of its target, it is capable of decapitating even an Ork.
                     Unfortunately, many an Ork has been observed to shrug off
                                                                                              elDar warhOsTs

it to the combating of the xenos menace, wherever it may be
found and whatever form it might take. The missions undertaken
by the Deathwatch are many and varied, and range from standing
sentinel against a general threat to accompanying an alien-
hunting Inquisitor in a desperate mission beyond the fringes of
known space. Despite the variety of mission profiles in which
the Deathwatch excels, there are a number that form the basis of
most operations.
    One of the simplest, yet arguably the most taxing, duties of
the Deathwatch is to stand eternal vigil against the actions of the
xenos. This is the basis of the system of Watch Fortresses and
Watch Stations. Each is located in an area where there exists a
known threat, or in a strategically significant region through which
such a threat might approach Imperial worlds. An example of the
former would be a Watch Station placed on the outer reaches of
a system known to harbour the remains of an ancient xenos race,
with its mission being to guard against the enemy’s return. An
example of the latter would be a Watch Fortress positioned at the
confluence of known warp routes, along which alien invasions are
known or are likely to travel.
    Investigation of potential threats is a vital task of the Deathwatch.
Individual Kill-teams are often called upon to perform sweeps of
areas in which dangerous aliens are suspected of operating. Newly
discovered worlds, visited by Explorators or Rogue Traders may              carry with them as much ammunition as possible. Investigation

   The Jericho reach, calixis secTor, anD Koronus expanse
   The Jericho Reach is bound by the ancient alien Warp Gate to two regions of space that lie on the other side of the Galaxy.
        he Calixis Sector is a province of the Imperium that borders the Halo Stars in Segmentum Obscurus. Conquered by a
   Crusade in the last few millennia, it is a young sector that is untouched by conflict on the scale that wracks the Jericho Reach.
   The peace of Calixis Sector, however, is a false skin, beneath which boils conspiracies and heresies of the most terrible potential.
   Haunted by an unnatural phenomena known as the Tyrant Star, and bound to a fate written in bloody prophecies, the Calixis
   Sector moves blindly into the future.
      Separated from the Calixis Sector by a boundary formed by the great warpstorm region known as the Maw lies the Koronus
   Expanse. An unexplored region of the Halo Stars, the Koronus Expanse is the haunt of lost planets, alien secrets, and the Rogue
   Traders who would tame them for the God-Emperor of Mankind. Hidden in the passage between the Calixis Sector and the
   Koronus Expanse is the terminus of the Warp Gate that connects both to the Jericho Reach. These three regions of the galaxy
   are bound together so tightly that the fate of one is the fate of all.
      More information on the Calixis Sector may be found in the Dark Heresy Rulebook and supplements, while the rogue
   TraDer Rulebook and supplements contain further details of the Koronus Expanse.

 Relations between the Deathwatch and the Crusade




                                                                                                                  XII: The Jericho Reach
The Achilus Crusade and the Deathwatch have different concerns in the Jericho Reach, concerns which often
are in close concord, but not always so.

The Achilus Crusade is commanded by the standing decree of the High Lords of Terra to re-conquer the
Jericho Reach, to bring its worlds within Imperial rule, to deny them to the Enemies of Mankind, and to
destroy those enemies wherever it encounters them. Its undisputed master is the Lord Militant Tetrarchus.
Beneath him are his favoured generals, admirals, and arch-confessors. Also in alliance with the Crusade are
the commanders of the various Space Marine detachments, Titan Legions, and Mechanicus Archmagos, over
which the Lord Militant’s authority, while notionally absolute, is never quite as certain.

The Deathwatch, on the other hand, have a far older and sacrosanct duty, mandated by high and ancient
authority, to maintain a watch over the Jericho Reach and protect against the darkness that gathers within
it and the doom that shall one day come to pass. The Deathwatch perform their duties in many ways, but
chiefly by fighting the enemies of Mankind and in carrying out their unrelenting vigil without cease or
respite. They are not, in fact, part of the Crusade, nor are they bound to obey its master or his agents before
their own oath-sworn duty.

At present, the Deathwatch, by their own will and to their own design, mount missions to destroy Tyranid
aggressors, recover xenos artefacts from Chaos-held worlds, and interfere and destroy Tau attempts to expand
their interests in the region. They conduct their own missions to gather intelligence and look to gauge and
stop the threats they encounter. The Deathwatch does these things according to their own agenda, and
because it is their nature, not because they are ordered to do so by the Crusade’s masters. On occasion, the
Deathwatch’s agenda may coincide with that of the Achilus Crusade, or they may respond favourably to a
request for assistance from its high command, or even to the distress calls of members of the Crusade forces.
In those cases and for that time, the two may work in concert toward a common goal. Once that goal is
achieved, however, the Deathwatch will pursue their own plans and look to their own counsel.

This autonomy has, on occasion, led to friction between the Deathwatch and those involved in the Achilus
Crusade, particularly those who command the Crusade (and therefore know something of the Deathwatch’s
presence in the Jericho Reach).

The existence of the Deathwatch is not a widely understood fact amongst the forces of the Achilus Crusade.
Members of Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes, Inquisitors, and other senior servants of the God-Emperor
know of the Deathwatch, but very few apart from senior commanders and powerful peers of the Imperium
are aware that the Deathwatch are active in the Jericho Reach. Fewer still of those worthies are aware of the
extent of Deathwatch operations or holdings in the area, let alone the existence of Watch Fortress Erioch.
However, thanks to its vigil, the Deathwatch has precise and in-depth knowledge of both the Crusade and
its dispossessions and progress. This knowledge outstrips that possessed by the masters of the Crusade, and
it is information the Deathwatch is not often inclined to share.

The duty of the Deathwatch is, after all, a secret one.

    Command of the Orpheus Salient was given to General
Curas, the youngest and most dynamic of Tetrarchus’ senior
command, seen by many as his favoured protégée. Some
privately doubted that the young Curas had the experience
to drive the swift advance demanded by his commander.
Their doubts proved to be in error, however, as the Orpheus
Salient swiftly went forward, destroying the petty empires of

secessionists and bringing loyal worlds back into the light of
the Emperor. As Curas’ forces progressed, they maintained a
steady stream of intelligence and assistance to the allied Space
Marine and Deathwatch forces, identifying suitable targets for
attack. In a decade and a half, the lead elements of the Orpheus
Salient had penetrated further into the Jericho Reach than any of
the Crusade’s other forces. The progress of the Orpheus salient
was so successful that Lord Militant Tetrarchus began to peel
elements away from it, increasing the stream of reinforcements
to the cauldron of death around the Cellebos Warzone.
     hen on 999812.M41, Astropathic communications
between the various worlds and battlegroups of the Orpheus
Salient began to blink out, and what limited messages did
get through were sporadic, sinister, and barely intelligible.
Astropaths and other sanctioned psykers across the length of
the salient awoke screaming from dreams filled with an endless
darkness and a thousand rustling whispers. Some took their
own lives and many others were reduced to babbling phrases
about ‘the rising tide,’ the ‘hungering depths,’ or similarly
doom laden ravings. Thanks to the communications blackout,
no-one in high command knew the disposition or activity of
forces along the salient, nor could they exert any cohesive
control over them, while the Adeptus Astartes grew withdrawn,
keeping their own grim council on the matter.                       which terrible events had begun to unfold. The doom of the

         The Tyranid attack into the Jericho Reach has left the forces of the Imperium confused and disordered.
         In part, this is because the Tyranids spread a shadow in front of their advance which disrupts the
         Astropathic communication on which the Imperium relies. Additionally, the Achilus Crusade has no
         means of knowing how many Tyranids swarm in the void towards the rim. This confusion has meant
         that no accurate verified estimation of the strength of the Tyranid forces has been made by the High
         Command, and both the Space Marines (and more importantly, the Deathwatch) have not shared their
         findings openly with the Crusade forces.

         In an atmosphere of rising panic and little information, some have claimed that the Tyranids must have
         vast numbers, while others judge that there is no evidence that supports anything other than an attack
         by a small splinter fleet, numbering perhaps a score of bioships. Most examining the unfolding situation,
         however, agree that they are facing a splinter of Hive Fleet Behemoth which became detached before or
         during the breaking of the great hive fleet in 745.M41.

         Although some amongst the Magos Biologos, Ordos Xenos and Administratum disputed the correctness
         of attaching a new designation to the Tyranid forces facing the Jericho Reach, such a designation was
         given on 989814.M41 by Lord Militant Tetrarchus. Once, it may have begun as a splinter of a greater
         fleet, but it was now a threat in and of itself—a threat of the present, not the victorious past. As such,
         it was given a name from ancient times that spoke of dooms and monsters dreamed of in an archaic age.

         That name is Hive Fleet Dagon.

                         and faithful to the belief that, in time, the Imperium would
                         return to restore it to its glory. Through the application of
                         brutal authority, a council of nobles called the Aquilan Pluracy
                         kept the population in order, the cathedrals un-profaned, and

                         population in order to yield up weaponry, provisions, and
                         regiments of troops to aid the Crusade.                                 eleusis

                            it the personal regiments of his chosen command. In its most famous action, the Battlegroup had the honour of cleansing

                         millennia beyond the reach of Imperial law.

                         The two most powerful groups the Crusade must contend with, however, are the binding forces which
                         maintain the Chaos war effort: a heretic army known as the Stigmartus, and several elite warbands of the
                         Traitor Legions that have come to the Reach to make war on the Imperium.

                         The Stigmartus are named for the ritual branding of their flesh with the sigil of their masters. Although they
                         are brutal and frenzied in the extreme, they maintain harsh discipline and military order from their cult-
                         overseers. The Stigmartus are organised very closely along lines which parody the structure of the Imperial
                         Guard itself. The commanding echelons of the Stigmartus are believed to be the remainder of the previous

                         One of the most terrifying and powerful contingents within the Chaos forces are the warbands and armies

             Lord Commander Ebongrave
             Sebiascor Ebongrave was a capable, even heroic officer who
             distinguished himself among the cavalry of the Dhkasin Hussars
             and became a trusted advisor to Warmaster Tetrarchus before
             being given command of the Canis Salient. Ebongrave has not
             borne his role well. This once-dashing cavalryman is a bitter,
             greying man who rarely leaves his fortified situation rooms in the
             Achilian Bastion. He has become increasingly paranoid and has
             ordered purges of regimental commanders, naval officer classes
             and Imperial governors, sometimes at the vaguest suggestion of
             Tau sympathies or ideological weakness. No matter how impossible
             the fight against the Tyranids becomes, he refuses to countenance
             diverting troops and ships from fighting the Tau. Some believe he
             is losing his grip on reality, while others think he sees reality all
             too well and is the only man who appreciates just how devious his
             xenos foes really are.

             The 14th Mortressan Highlanders
             When Ebongrave needs people he can trust to execute their fellow
             Imperial citizens or soldiers, he calls upon the 14th Mortressan.
             Recruited from the Calixian Death world of Mortressa, these
             veterans believe that life is meaningless and that only the manner
             of a man’s death matters. They have no compunction or guilt
             about what they do, a psychological foible that Ebongrave values
             greatly. Mortressans serve in the Field Purgation Platoons who
             root out ideological failings among Guard regiments, and in the
             execution details in the Black Zone. The guardsman standing
             watch over an interrogation cell in Sepulchre Sigma is likely to
             hail from Mortressa.

                    The Tiers of enemies
                    The       enemies      presented       in
                    Deathwatch are broken into tiers.
                    Each tier represents a level of
                    challenge to the Battle-Brothers
                    of the Deathwatch and also
                    provides Games Masters with an
                    indication of how that enemy fits
                    into either a small skirmish or a
                    large battle. The enemies presented in
                    this chapter are broken into three tiers:
                        Troops: Enemies in the Troop tier
                    make up the bulk of enemy forces in
                    large scale engagements. From Tau Fire
                    Warriors to Tyranid Hormaguants, some
                    antagonists in this tier may be highly
                    trained, whilst others are little more than
                    cannon fodder. In general, an individual
                    or small number of Troop tier enemies are
                    no match for an individual Battle-Brother,
                    let alone an entire Kill-team.
                        Elites: Individually or in small groups,
                    Elite enemies are worthy foes for a single Battle-
                    Brother no matter how mighty he may be. In
                    equal numbers, Elites can pose a deadly threat
                    to a squad of Battle-Brothers. Enemies in the
                    Elite Tier come in the form of Chaos Space
                    Marines, Tau Stealth Suits, and Tyranid Warriors.

                      The Tau practice a wild array of martial philosophies, but in essence, all are variations on two main doctrines. The first,
                      called the Mon’ka, or ‘Killing Blow’, dictates that the Fire Warriors wait patiently in ambush, often for days, before
                      unleashing an overwhelming attacks upon their foes. In this style of warfare, timing and placement are all, with much
                      preparation and reconnaissance being undertaken to ensure that the Tau dictate every aspect of the attack. The second
                      philosophy is the Kauyon, or ‘Patient Hunter’, in which a lure, often a Tau unit but sometimes a position the enemy
                      wish to secure, is used to draw the foe onwards. At the most opportune moment, the Tau unleash a devastating counter-
                      attack against which few can stand. A Tau Commander must be a Master of both faces of war, and of the countless
                      variants of each. Many go on to establish training academies having retired from active service, where new generations
                      of commanders study under the august tutelage of a true Master in the arts of war.

fell before the onslaught of what would come to be named
Hive Fleet Behemoth in 745.M41, the Tyranid threat has since
ravaged hundreds if not thousands of star systems, principally
in the Segmentum Ultima, like a vast and monstrous set of jaws
biting down on the galactic plain, although no corner of the wide
Imperium has so far proved beyond the reach of the fragmented
tendrils of the onrushing nightmare tide. Indeed, the Genestealer,
long an insidious threat that has troubled Mankind for millennia
appears now to be a harbinger of the Tyranids, and the dim secrets
of the ancient past hint at past threats, but never so widespread or
potentially catastrophic as at present.
    In battle, the Tyranids are a horror beyond comprehension, a
monstrous tide of merciless claw, venom, and fang that cannot be
bargained with, reasoned with, or surrendered to. It strikes with the
relentless fury of a rabid beast, yet it is driven by a cold and alien
intelligence that makes every component of the swarm—from
lowly flesh-boring parasites to gargantuan war-creatures the size
of a Battle Titan—far more dangerous than any mere animal could
ever be. Carried through the void on immense living bioships, the
seemingly numberless and inexhaustible hive fleets are attracted to
worlds rich with life like a great ocean predator may be drawn to
blood in the water. They descend upon their prey-world, raining
down poisonous spores that taint and pollute the atmosphere and
unleashing murderous hunting creatures to slaughter any animal
life that might pose a threat to consumption. Depending on the
particular fleet’s resources and size, other adaptive and mutating
war-beasts and biologically created leader-creatures will also be
unleashed to wage an unrelenting war of extermination on the
world, a war that will only end in one of two ways: the defeat and
purging of the Tyranid assault by the defenders, or the complete
consumption and reduction of all living matter by the Hive Fleet,
a dead world left in its wake.

  modifying enemies
  The enemies presented in this chapter can, and should, be modified by a Game Master to create the types of enemies
  they require for their game. Some options and variations are presented as part of the enemy profiles but the possible
  variety of enemies far exceeds these, and a Games Master should feel free to make adjustments to them as they see fit. If,
  for example, a game requires a group of Renegade Militia armed with missile launchers they can be created by removing
  their autoguns, giving them missile launchers and the Heavy Weapon Training (Launcher) Talent.

  enemy Profile PresenTaTion
  In all the entries presented in this chapter the characteristics, movement values and weapon damages have been presented
  with all modifications included. For example, a Chaos Space Marine’s Strength includes the +20 increase from his
  Astartes Power Armour, and his Strength Bonus matches this and the effects of the Unnatural Strength Trait. Weapon
  damages include the effects of the enemy’s Strength Bonus and Talents that always apply to damage such as the Crushing
  Blow talent. Talents, Traits and Special rules that have a variable effect or will only apply in particular circumstances,
  such as the Hammer Blow Talent, have not been combined into the profiles presented here. It is also important to note
  that NPCs are not necessarily bound to follow the same strictures for their profiles as player characters.

                         Extraction
                  “What is courage then? Is it the response of fight over flight when
                  danger looms sudden and unexpected? No, such mere animal instinct!
XIV: Extraction




                  Courage rather is the willful scorn of death, and the deliberate
                  acceptance of suffering, for honour, for duty, or for the Emperor.
                  Beyond this, the true glory—this is the will to face horror, to turn
                  death upon itself, to strangle nightmare with bare hands, and to do it
                  unsung and unknown for the salvation of Mankind.”

                           bloody tide of war. This once-Imperial domain is beset on
                           all sides by the terrors of the xenos and the evil of dark-
                  hearted men. Cast amid its war-torn and threatened worlds is the
                  industrial moon of Tantalus in the embattled Castobel system in
                  that part of the Reach known as the Orpheus Salient. For more
                  than five Solar months now, the Castobel system has come under
                  the assault of the all-devouring Tyranid menace, and Tantalus is
                  no exception. While the fate of the hive world of Castobel that
                  gives this star system its name hangs in the balance still, Tantalus
                  has not been so fortunate, and the outlying colony is now in its
                  final death throes.
                      With the battle for Tantalus lost, and the jaws of the Tyranids
                  closing inexorably around this moon, the few survivors that
                  remain are desperately caught between a doomed struggle to
                  survive and desperate hopes for escape. However, the lives of all        transmissions from the Magos indicate both his personal survival

                      For Tantalus, the end has come very abruptly. The battle was
                  tipped in the Tyranids’ favour by the appearance of one of their

   a few extra notes for the GM
   The Tantalus Extraction is an adventure based on an ongoing situation into which the player characters are thrust. It is important
   to remember that the characters that the Kill-team may find awaiting them at Pyroclast-Gamma-9 have their own motivations
   and fears, and have no idea that the Deathwatch has become involved in the situation (the exception is Magos they have come to
   rescue). This means that the NPCs may react in any number of ways, from sudden hope, to awe and outright terror. Remember
   that Space Marines, while Mankind’s saviours on countless occasions, are often feared by normal men and women throughout
   the Imperium. They are known as ‘The Angels of Death’ for a reason. Once inside Pyroclast-Gamma-9’s environs, the player
   characters have a free hand about how to proceed and what leads and plans to follow. It is up to you, as the GM, to respond to
   their actions, as you feel appropriate. When GMing an adventure like this one, where there is no set ‘right’ path for the player
   characters to follow, you should always feel free to embellish the details, come up with new encounters, and have events and
   individuals react to the player characters’ actions. This will always make for a tighter story, give a sense of empowerment to your
   players and, accordingly, ensure a better game all round. Adventures like this one, even though they can be very combat oriented
   and have a relatively simple goal, demand a little more from the GM than a simple ‘dungeon bash’ style combat mission, simply
   because they are so freeform. As the GM, you will be required to think on your feet, keep an idea of what’s going on in your
   head and respond to whatever plans and ideas your player’s might come up.
       The key things are to be firm but fair; don’t be afraid to have NPCs act or react adversely and violently if the player characters’
   actions make this the logical outcome. Of course, reward quick thinking and good ideas on the players’ part with additional
   information, aid, and assistance as warranted.
       It is important to be familiar with the details of the adventure itself, not simply so you know who is where and doing what,
   but also so you can gauge how the significant NPCs will react to the unexpected. Thus you can add to things as you go along
   without risk of messing up the plot. Although it may sound obvious, a handy notebook to record names and the like as you go
   along, not to mention details such as the countdown tally, is essential. This is all a bit of work, as you may have guessed, but
   can also be hugely rewarding in its own right. If you’ve volunteered to be the GM, you’re probably something of a storyteller
   at heart, and will enjoy because the experience—you are master of your own epic story, packed with as much action and dark
   adventure as you wish.

    ROLEPLAYING IN THE GRIM DARKNESS
        OF THE 41ST MILLENNIUM
    You are a Space Marine, one of the Imperium’s supreme
      warriors. Genetically enhanced and engineered with
     special implants to be the ultimate soldier, you are far
      stronger, tougher—and deadlier—than any human
     being. You have been selected to join an elite warrior
    brotherhood of alien-hunters known as the Deathwatch.

      As a Deathwatch Space Marine, your duty is to seek
       out vile alien ruins on forbidden worlds, venture
      behind enemy lines to perform special missions no-
        one else can accomplish, and confront the most
     dangerous challenges the galaxy possesses...challenges
     that only the heroes of the Space Marines can defeat.

             quickly, followed by a lifetime of possibilities
                  with an expanded Speciality system.
