Carouse (Basic)

‘Toughness

‘The Carouse Skill is used to resist the effects of aleohol and
nateotics. Frequent imbibers can build up quite a tolerance to
alcohols and other drugs, remaining clear-headed and lucid
‘while those across the table find their judgement or capabilities
diminished. The character makes a Skill Test whenever he
suffers the effects of alcohol or similar intoxicants (naturally,
for Space Marines, this requires imbibing of truly prodigious
amounts or toxicity). Each time he would otherwise suffer
fiom the effects of an intoxicant, make a Carouse Test. Failure
indicates he gains a level of Fatigue or suffers the side effects
of the substance. Should the character lose consciousness, he
remains passed out for a number of hours equal to 1410 minus
his Toughness Bonus (minimum 1 hour)
