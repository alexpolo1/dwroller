A character can damage a Horde by shooting it with ranged
weapons or attacking it in melee. These attacks are treated
as if they are against a single creature even though they may
represent mowing down ranks of enemies or scything through
many foes.
Characters must still roll to hit a Horde, but the appropriate size
bonus should apply to these tests based on the Horde’s Magnitude.
Weapons that can fire on full, or semi-auto will cause additional hits.
These hits must be allocated against the Horde and not any individual
Lieutenants or Masters that may also be present.

• Each hit that causes any amount of damage reduces a Horde’s
Magnitude by one. Therefore, an attack that, after accounting
for armour and Toughness Bonus, causes 15 points of
damage reduces the Horde’s Magnitude by 1. The deliberate
consequence of this is that sustained fire and blast weapons are
much more effective against Hordes than weapons which fire
only one shot; a lascannon is a weapon for destroying tanks, not
mowing down large numbers of infantry.
• Weapons that inflict Explosive Damage (X) gain a bonus against
Hordes, and count as having inflicted one additional Hit.
• Locations are not used when fighting a Horde.
• A Horde has a single armour value at is applied to all damage
rather than different armour values for different locations.
• Hordes may be Pinned as normal (with the entire Horde making
a single Willpower Test). However, Hordes gain a bonus to their
Willpower Tests to resist pinning equal to its Magnitude.
Melee: When fighting against a Horde in Melee, a Space Marine
inflicts one hit for every two Degrees of Success on his Weapon
Skill Test. Melee weapons with the Power Field Quality inflict one
additional hit.
Blast Weapons: A Blast weapon that hits a Horde hits a number
of times equal to its Blast value. So a grenade with Blast (4) will
automatically hit four times if successfully lobbed into the Horde.
